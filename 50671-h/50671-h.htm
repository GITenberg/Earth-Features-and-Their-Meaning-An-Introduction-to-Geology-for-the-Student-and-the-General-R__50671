<h2 class="p4">PREFACE</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> series of readings contained in the present volume give in
somewhat expanded form the substance of a course of illustrated
lectures which has now for several years been delivered each
semester at the University of Michigan. The keynote of the course
may be found in the dominant characteristics of the different earth
features and the geological processes which have been betrayed
in the shaping of them. Such a geological examination of landscape
is replete with fascinating revelations, and it lends to the
study of Nature a deep meaning which cannot but enhance the
enjoyment of her varied aspects.</p>

<p>That there is a real place for such a cultural study of geology
within the University is believed to be shown by the increasing
number of students who have elected the work. Even more than
in former years the American travels afar by car or steamship, and
the earth’s surface features in all their manifold diversity are thus
one after the other unrolled before him. The thousands who each
year cross the Atlantic to roam over European countries may by
historical, literary, or artistic studies prepare themselves to derive
an exquisite pleasure as they visit places identified with past
achievement of one form or another. Yet the Channel coast, the
gorge of the Rhine, the glaciers of Switzerland, and the wild scenery
of Norway or Scotland have each their fascinating story to tell
of a history far more remote and varied. To read this history, the
runic characters in which it is written must first of all be mastered;
for in every landscape there are strong individual lines of character
such as the pen artist would skillfully extract for an outline
sketch. Such <i>character profiles</i> are often many times repeated in
each landscape, and in them we have a key to the historical record.</p>

<p>An object of the present readings has thus been to enable the
student to himself pick out in each landscape these more significant
lines and so read directly from Nature. In the landscapes which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
have been represented, the aim has been to draw as far as possible
upon localities well known to travelers and likely to be visited,
either because of their historical interest or their purely scenic
attractions. It should thus be possible for a tourist in America
or Europe to pursue his landscape studies whenever he sets out
upon his travels. The better to aid him in this endeavor, some
suggestions concerning the itinerary of journeys have been supplied
in an appendix.</p>

<p>Regarded as a textbook of geology, the present work offers some
departures from existing examples. Though it has been customary
to combine in a single text historical with dynamical and structural
geology, a tendency has already become apparent to treat the historical
division apart from the others. Again, a desire to treat the
science of geology comprehensively has led some authors into including
so many subjects as to render their texts unnecessarily
encyclopedic and correspondingly uninteresting to the general
reader. It is the author’s belief that there is a real need for a book
which may be read intelligently by the general public, and it must
be recognized that the beginner in the subject cannot cover the
entire field by a single course of readings. The present work has,
therefore, been prepared with a view to selecting for study those
dominant geological processes which are best illustrated by features
in northern North America and Europe. It is this desire to illustrate
the readings by travels afield, which accounts for the prominence
given to the subject of glaciation; for the larger number of
colleges and universities in both America and Europe are surrounded
by the heavy accumulations that have resulted from former glaciations.</p>

<p>Emphasis has also been placed upon the dependence of the dominant
geological processes of any region upon existing climatic conditions,
a fact to which too little attention has generally been given.
This explains the rather full treatment of desert regions, of which,
in our own country particularly, much may be illustrated upon the
transcontinental railway journeys.</p>

<p>More than in most texts the attempt has here been made to teach
directly through the eye with the efficient aid of apt illustrations
intimately interwoven with the text. For such success as has been
reached in this endeavor, the author is greatly indebted to two
students of the University of Michigan,&mdash;Mr. James H. Meier,
who has prepared the line drawings of landscapes, and Mr. Hugh M.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
Pierce, who has draughted the diagrams. Though credit has in
most cases been given where illustrations have been made from
another’s photographs, yet especial mention should here be made
of the debt to Dr. H. W. Fairbanks of Berkeley, California, whose
beautiful and instructive photographs are reproduced upon many
a page.</p>

<p>As given at the University of Michigan, the lectures reflected
in the present volume are supplemented by excursions and by so
much laboratory practice as is necessary to become familiar with the
more common minerals and rocks, and to read intelligently the usual
topographical and geological maps. In the appendices the means
for carrying out such studies, in part with newly devised apparatus,
have been indicated.</p>

<p>The scope of the book precludes the possibility of furnishing the
reader with the sources for the body of fact and theory which is
presented, although much may be inferred from the names which
appear beneath the illustrations, and more definite knowledge will
be found in the references to literature supplied at the ends of
chapters. A large amount of original and unpublished material
is for a similar reason unlabeled, and it has been left for the professional
geologist to detect these new strands which have been
drawn into the web.</p>

<p class="pc4 elarge">EARTH FEATURES AND THEIR MEANING</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER I</h2>

<p class="pch">THE COMPILATION OF EARTH HISTORY</p>

<p><b>The sources of the history.</b>&mdash;The science which deals with the
chapters of earth history that antedate the earliest human writings
is geology. The pages of the record are the layers of rock
which make up the outer shell of our world. Here as in old
manuscripts pages are sometimes found to be missing, and on
others the writing is largely effaced so as to be indistinct or even
illegible. An intelligent interpretation of this record requires a
knowledge of the materials and the structure of the earth, as
well as a proper conception of the agencies which have caused
change and so developed the history. These agencies in operation
are physical and chemical processes, and so the sciences of
physics and chemistry are fundamental in any extended study of
geology. Not only is geology, so to speak, founded upon chemistry
and physics, but its field overlaps that of many other important
sciences. The earliest earth history has to do with the
form, size, and physical condition of a minor planet in the solar
system. The earliest portion of the story belongs therefore to
astronomy, and no sharp line can be drawn to separate this chapter
from those later ones which are more clearly within the domain
of geology.</p>


<p><b>Subdivisions of geology.</b>&mdash;The terms “cosmic geology” and
“astronomic geology” have sometimes been used to cover the
astronomy of the earth planet. The later earth history develops,
among other things, the varied forms of animal and vegetable life
which have had a definite order of appearance. Their study is
to a large extent zoölogy and botany, though here considered
from an essentially different viewpoint. This subdivision of our
science is called paleontological geology or paleontology, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
in common usage includes the plant as well as the animal world,
or what is sometimes called paleobotany. In order to fix the
order of events in geological history, these biological studies are
necessary, for the pages of the record have many of them been
misplaced as a result of the vicissitudes of earth history, and the
remains of life in the rock layers supply a pagination from which
it is possible to correctly rearrange the misplaced pages. As compiled
into a consecutive history of the earth since life appeared
upon it, we have the division of historical geology; though this
differs but little from stratigraphical geology, the emphasis in the
case of the former being placed on the history itself and in the
latter upon the arrangement of events&mdash;the pagination of the
record.</p>

<p>So far as they are known to us, the materials of which the
earth is composed are minerals grouped into various characteristic
aggregates known as rocks. Here the science is founded upon
mineralogy as well as chemistry, and a study of the rock materials
of the earth is designated petrographical geology or petrography.
The various rocks which enter into the composition of the earth’s
outer shell&mdash;the only portion known to us from direct observation&mdash;are
built into it in an architecture which, when carefully
studied, discloses important events in the earth’s history. The
division of the science which is concerned with earth architecture
is geotectonic or structural geology.</p>


<p><b>The study of earth features and their significance.</b>&mdash;The
features upon the surface of the earth have all their deep significance,
and if properly understood, a flood of light is thrown,
not only upon present conditions, but upon many chapters of the
earth’s earlier history. Here the relation of our study to topography
and geography is very close, so that the lines of separation
are but ill defined. The terms “physiographical geology”,
“physiography”, and “geomorphology” are concerned with the
configuration of the earth’s surface&mdash;its physiognomy&mdash;and with
the genesis of its individual surface features. It is this genetical
side of physiography which separates it from topography
and lends it an absorbing interest, though it causes it to largely
overlap the division of dynamical geology or the study of
geological processes. In fact, the difference between dynamical
geology and physiography is largely one of emphasis, the stress<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
being laid upon the processes in the former and upon the resultant
features in the latter.</p>

<p>Under dynamical geology are included important subdivisions,
such as seismic geology, or the study of earthquakes, and vulcanology,
or the study of volcanoes. Another large subject,
glacial geology, belongs within the broad frontier common to both
dynamical geology and physiography. A relatively new subdivision
of geological science is orientational geology, which is
concerned with the trend of earth features, and is closely related
both to physiography and to dynamical and structural geology.</p>

<p><b>Tabular recapitulation.</b>&mdash;In a slightly different arrangement
from the above order of mention, the subdivisions of geology are
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pc2 reduct"><i>Subdivisions of Geology</i></p>

<table id="t01" summary="t01">

</table>

<p class="p1">In one way or another all of the above subdivisions of geology
are in some way concerned in the genesis of earth physiognomy,
and they must therefore be given consideration in a work which
is devoted to a study of the meaning of earth features. The
compiled record of the rocks is, however, something quite apart
and without pertinence to the present work. As already indicated
its subdivisions are:&mdash;</p>

</table>

<p class="p1">In every attempt at systematic arrangement difficulties are
encountered, usually because no one consideration can be used
throughout as the basis of classification. Such terms as “economic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
geology” and “mining geology” have either a pedagogical
or a commercial significance, and so would hardly fit into the
system which we have outlined.</p>


<p><b>Geological processes not universal.</b>&mdash;It is inevitable that the
geology of regions which are easily accessible for study should
have absorbed the larger measure of attention; but it should not
be forgotten that geology is concerned with the history of the
entire world, and that perspective will be lost and erroneous
conclusions drawn if local conditions are kept too often before
the eyes. To illustrate by a single instance, the best studied
regions of the globe are those in which fairly abundant precipitation
in the form of rain has fitted the land for easy conditions of
life, and has thus permitted the development of a high civilization.
In degree, and to some extent also in kind, geologic processes
are markedly different within those widely extended regions which,
because either arid or cold, have been but ill fitted for human
habitation. Yet in the historical development of the earth, those
geologic processes which obtain in desert or polar regions are none
the less important because less often and less carefully observed.</p>


<p><b>Change, and not stability, the order of nature.</b>&mdash;Man is ever
prone to emphasize the importance of apparent facts to the disadvantage
of those less clearly revealed though equally potent.
The ancient notion of the <i>terra firma</i>, the safe and solid ground,
arose because of its contrast with the far more mobile bodies of
water; but this illusion is quickly dispelled with the sudden quaking
of the ground. Experience has clearly shown that, both upon
and beneath the earth’s surface, chemical and physical changes
are going on, subject to but little interruption. “The hills rock-ribbed
and ancient as the sun” is a poetical metaphor; for the
Himalayas, the loftiest mountains upon the globe, were, to speak
in geological terms, raised from the sea but yesterday. Even
to-day they are pushing up their heads, only to be relentlessly
planed down through the action of the atmosphere, of ice, and of
running water. Even more than has generally been supposed, the
earth suffers change. Often within the space of a few seconds,
to the accompaniment of a heavy earthquake, many square miles
of territory are bodily uplifted, while neighboring areas may be
relatively depressed. Thus change, and not stability, is the order
of nature.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>


<p><b>Observational geology <i>versus</i> speculative philosophy.</b>&mdash;There
appears to be a more or less prevalent notion that the views which
are held by scientists in one generation are abandoned by those
of the next; and this is apt to lead to the belief that little is really
known and that much is largely guessed. Some ground there
undoubtedly is for such skepticism, though much of it may be
accounted for by a general failure among scientists, as well as
others, to clearly differentiate that which is essentially speculative
from what is based broadly upon observed facts. Even with
extended observation, the possibility of explaining the facts in
more than one way is not excluded; but the line is nevertheless
a broad one which separates this entire field of observation from
what is essentially speculative philosophy. To illustrate: the
mechanics of the action which goes on within volcanic craters is
now fairly well understood as a result of many and extended
observations, and it is little likely that future generations of
geologists will discredit the main conclusions which have been
reached. The cause of the rise of the lava to the earth’s surface
is, on the other hand, much less clearly demonstrated, and the
views which are held express rather the differing opinions than
any clear deductions from observation. Again, and similarly, the
physical history of the great continental glaciers of the so-called
“ice age” is far more thoroughly known than that of any existing
glacier of the same type; but the cause of the climatic changes
which brought on the glaciation is still largely a matter for speculation.</p>

<p>In the present work, the attempt will be, so far as possible, to
give an exposition of geologic processes and the earth features
which result from them, with hints only at those ultimate causes
which lie hidden in the background.</p>


<p><b>The scientific attitude and temper.</b>&mdash;The student of science
should make it his aim, not only clearly to separate in his studies
the proximate from the ultimate causes of observed phenomena,
but he should keep his mind always open for reaching individual
conclusions. No doctrines should be accepted finally upon faith
merely, but subject rather to his own reasoning processes. This
should not be interpreted to mean that concerning matters of
which he knows little or nothing he should not pay respect to the
recognized authorities; but his acceptance of any theory should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
be subject to review so soon as his own horizon has been sufficiently
enlarged. False theories could hardly have endured so long in the
past, had not too great respect been given to authorities, and individual
reasoning processes been held too long in subjection.</p>


<p><b>The value of the hypothesis.</b>&mdash;Because all the facts necessary
for a full interpretation of observed phenomena are not at one’s
hand, this should not be made to stand in the way of provisional
explanations. If science is to advance, the use of hypothesis is
absolutely essential; but the particular hypothesis adopted should
be regarded as temporary and as indicating a line of observation
or of experimentation which is to be followed in testing it. Thus
regarded with an open mind, inadequate hypotheses are eventually
found to be untenable, whereas correct explanations of the
facts by the same process are confirmed. Most hypotheses of
science are but partially correct, for we now “see through a glass
darkly”; but even so, if properly tested, the false elements in the
hypothesis are one after the other eliminated as the embodied
truth is confirmed and enlarged. Thus “working hypothesis”
passes into theory and becomes an integral part of science.</p>

<p class="pch">THE FIGURE OF THE EARTH</p>

<p><b>The lithosphere and its envelopes.</b>&mdash;The stony part of the
earth is known as the <i>lithosphere</i>, of which only a thin surface
shell is known to us from direct observation. The relatively unknown
central portion, or “core”, is sometimes referred to as the
centrosphere. Inclosing the lithosphere is a water envelope, the
<i>hydrosphere</i>, which comprises the oceans and inland bodies of
water, and has a mass <sup>1</sup>/<sub>4540</sub> that of the lithosphere. If uniformly
distributed, the hydrosphere would cover the lithosphere to the
depth of about two miles, instead of being collected in basins as it
now is. Though apparently not continuous, if we take into account
the zone of underground water upon the continents, the hydrosphere
may properly be considered as a continuous film about the
lithosphere. It is a fact of much significance that all the ocean
basins are connected, so that the levels are adjusted to furnish a
common record of deposits over the entire surface that is sea-covered.</p>

<p>Enveloping the hydrosphere is the gaseous envelope, the <i>atmosphere</i>,
with a mass <sup>1</sup>/<sub>1200000</sub> that of the lithosphere. The atmosphere
is a mixture of the gases oxygen and nitrogen in parts by
volume of one of the former to four of the latter, with a relatively
small percentage of carbon dioxide. Locally, and at special
seasons, the atmosphere may be charged with relatively large
percentages of water vapor; and we shall see that both the carbon
dioxide and the vapor contents are of the utmost importance in
geological processes and in the influence upon climate. Unlike
the water which composes the hydrosphere, the gases of the
atmosphere are compressible. Forced down by the weight of
superincumbent gas, the layers of the atmosphere at the level of
the sea sustain a pressure of about fifteen pounds to the square
inch; but this pressure steadily decreases in ascending to higher
levels. From direct instrumental observation, the air has now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
been investigated to a height of more than twelve miles from the
earth’s surface.</p>


<p><b>The evolution of ideas concerning the earth’s figure.</b>&mdash;The
ideas which in all ages have been promulgated concerning the
figure of the earth have been many and varied. Though among
them are not wanting the purely speculative and fantastic, it will
be interesting to pass in review such theories as have grown directly
out of observation.</p>

<p>The ancient Hebrews and the Babylonians were dwellers of the
desert, and in the mountains which bounded their horizon they
saw the confines of the earth. Pushing at last westward beyond
the mountains, they found the Mediterranean, and thus arrived at
the view that the earth was a disk with a rim of mountains which
was floated upon water. The rare but violent rainfalls to which
they were accustomed&mdash;the desert cloudburst&mdash;further led them
to the belief that the mountain rim was continued upward in a
dome or firmament of transparent crystal upon which the heavenly
bodies were hung and from which out of “windows of heaven”
the water “which is above the earth” was poured out upon the
earth’s surface. Fantastic as this theory may seem to-day, it
was founded upon observation, and it well illustrates the dangers
of reasoning from observation within too limited a field.</p>

<p>As soon as men began to sail the sea, it was noticed that the
water surface is convex, for the masts of ships were found to remain
visible long after their hulls had disappeared below the horizon.
It is difficult to say how soon the idea of the earth’s rotundity was
acquired, but it is certainly of great antiquity. The Dominican
monk Vincentius of Beauvais, in a work completed in 1244, declared
that the surfaces of the earth and the sea were both spherical.
The poet Dante made it clear that these surfaces were one, and
in his famous address upon “The Water and the Land”, which
was delivered in Verona on the 20th of January, 1320, he added
a statement that the continents rise higher than the ocean. His
explanation of this was that the continents are pulled up by the
attraction of the fixed stars after the manner of attraction of
magnets, thus giving an early hint of the force of gravitation.</p>

<p>The earth’s rotundity may be said to have been first proven
when Magellan’s ships in 1521 had accomplished the circumnavigation
of the globe. Circumnavigation, soon after again carried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
out by Sir Francis Drake, proved that the earth is a closed body
bounded by curving surfaces in part enveloped by the oceans and
everywhere by the atmosphere. The great discovery of Copernicus
in 1530 that the earth, like Venus, Mars, and the other planets,
revolves about the sun as a part of a system, left little room for
doubt that the figure of the earth was essentially that of a sphere.</p>

<p><b>The oblateness of the earth.</b>&mdash;Every schoolboy is to-day familiar
with the fact that the earth departs from a perfect spherical
figure by being flattened at the ends of its axis of rotation. The
polar diameter is usually given as <sup>1</sup>/<sub>299</sub> shorter than the equatorial
one. This oblateness of the spheroid was proven by geodesists
when they came to compare the lengths of measured degrees of
arc upon meridians in high and in low latitudes.</p>

The shell represented in <i>b</i> is
<sup>1</sup>/<sub>100</sub> of the earth’s radius, and
in <i>a</i> this zone is magnified
for comparison with surface
inequalities.</p>
</div></div>

<p>The oblateness of the geoid is well understood from accepted
hypotheses to be the result of the once more rapid rotation of the
planet when its materials were more plastic, and hence more responsive
to deformation. An elastic hoop rotating rapidly about
an axis in its plane appears to the eye as a solid, and becomes
flattened at the ends of its axis in proportion as the velocity of
rotation is increased. Like the earth, the other planets in the
solar system are similarly oblate and by amounts dependent on the
relative velocities of rotation.</p>

<p>The departure of the geoid from the spherical surface, owing to
its oblateness, is so small that in the figures which we shall use for
illustration it would be less than the thickness of a line. Since it
is well recognized and not important in our present consideration,
we shall for the time being speak of the figure of the earth in terms
of departures from a standard spherical surface.</p>

<p><b>The arrangement of oceans and continents.</b>&mdash;There are other
departures from a spherical surface than the oblateness just referred
to, and these departures, while not large, are believed to be
full of significance. Lest the reader should gain a wrong impression
of their magnitude, it may be well to introduce a diagram
drawn to scale and representing prominent elevations and depressions
of the earth (<a href="#f1">Fig. 1</a>).</p>

<p>Wrong impressions concerning the figure of the lithosphere are
sometimes gained because its depressions are obliterated by the
oceans. The oceans are, indeed, useful to us in showing where
the depressions are located, but the figure of the earth which we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
are considering is the naked surface of the rock. In a broad way,
the earth’s shape will be given by the arrangement of the oceans
and the continents. As
soon as we take up the
study of this arrangement,
we find that quite significant
facts of distribution
are disclosed.</p>

reciprocal relation of the land and sea areas (after
Gregory and Arldt).</p>
</div></div>

<p>One of the most significant
facts involved in the
distribution of land and
sea, is a concentration of
the land areas within the
northern and the seas
within the southern hemisphere.
The noteworthy
exception is the occurrence
of the great and high
Antarctic continent centered
near the earth’s
south pole; and there are extensions of the northern
continent as narrowing land masses to the southward
of the equator. Hardly less significant than the existence
of land and water hemispheres is the reciprocal
or antipodal distribution of land and sea (<a href="#f2">Fig. 2</a>).
A third fact of significance is a dovetailing together of sea and
land along an east-and-west
direction.
While the seas are
generally <span class="font">A</span>-shaped
and narrow northward,
the land masses
are <span class="font">V</span>-shaped and narrow
southward, <i>but
this occurs mainly in
the southern hemisphere</i>.
Lastly, there
is some indication of
a belt of sea dividing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
the land masses into northern and southern portions along the
course of a great circle which makes a small angle with the earth’s
equator. Thus the western continent is nearly divided by a
mediterranean sea,&mdash;the Caribbean,&mdash;and the eastern is in part
so divided by the separation of Europe from Africa.</p>

is tending, a tetrahedron with symmetrically truncated
angles.</p>
</div></div>

<p><b>The figure toward which the earth is tending.</b>&mdash;Thus far in
our discussion of the earth’s figure we have been guided entirely
by the present distribution
of land and
water. There are,
however, depressions
upon the surface
of the land, in
some cases extending
below the level
of the sea, which are
not to-day occupied
by water. By far
the most notable of
these is the great
Caspian Depression,
which with its extension
divides central
and eastern Asia
upon the east from Africa and Europe upon the west. This
depression was quite recently occupied by the sea, and when
added to the present ocean basins to indicate depressions of the
lithosphere, it shows that the earth’s figure departs from the
standard spheroid <i>in the direction</i> of the form represented in
<a href="#f3">Fig. 3</a>. This form approximates to a tetrahedron, a figure bounded
by four equal triangular faces, here with symmetrically truncated
angles. Of all regular figures with plane surfaces the tetrahedron
has the smallest volume for a given surface, and it presents moreover
a reciprocal relation of projection to depression. Every
line passing through its center thus finds the surface nearer than
the average distance upon one side and correspondingly farther
upon the other (<a href="#f4">Fig. 4</a>).</p>

<p><b>Astronomical <i>versus</i> geodetic observations.</b>&mdash;Confirmation of
the conclusions arrived at from the arrangement of oceans and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
continents has been secured in other fields. It was pointed out
that the earth’s oblateness was proven by comparison of the
measured degrees of latitude upon the earth’s surface in lower and
higher latitudes, the degree being found longer as the pole is
approached. Any variation from the spherical surface must obviously
increase the size of the measured degree of latitude in
proportion to the departure from the standard form, and so
the tetrahedral figure with one of its angles at the south pole
will require that the degrees
of latitude be longer in the
southern than they are in the
northern hemisphere. This
has been found by measurement
to be the case, and the
result is further confirmed by
pendulum studies upon the
distribution of the earth’s attraction
or gravity. If less of
the mass of the earth is concentrated
in the southern
hemisphere, its attraction as
measured in vibrations of
the pendulum should be correspondingly
smaller.</p>

     <div class="cf"><p class="ch250"><span class="smcap">Fig. 4.</span>&mdash;A truncated tetrahedron, showing
how the depression upon one side of the center
is balanced by the opposite projection.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Other confirmations of the tetrahedral figure of the earth have
been derived from a comparison of astronomical data, which assume
the earth to be a perfect spheroid, with geodetic measurements,
which are based upon direct measurements. Thus the arc measured
in an east-and-west direction across Europe revealed a different
curvature near the angle of the tetrahedral figure from what
was found farther to the eastward.</p>


<p><b>Changes of figure during contraction of a spherical body.</b>&mdash;If
we inquire why the earth in cooling should tend to approach the
tetrahedral figure, an answer is easily found. When formed,
the earth appears to have been a but slightly oblate spheroid,
or practically a sphere&mdash;the shape which of all incloses the
most space for a given surface. Cooled and solidified at the surface
to the temperature of the surrounding air, and the core
still hot and continuing to lose heat, the core must continue to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
contract though the outer shell is no longer able to do so. The
superficial area being thus maintained constant while the volume
continues to diminish, the figure must change from the initial one
of greatest bulk to others of smaller volume, and ultimately, if the
process should continue indefinitely, to the tetrahedron, which of
all regular figures has the minimum volume for a given surface.</p>

<p>That a contracting sphere does indeed pass through such a
series of changes has been shown by the behavior of contracting
soap bubbles and of rubber balloons, as well as by experiments
upon the exhaustion of air contained in hollow metal spheres of
only moderate strength. In all these instances, the ultimate
form produced indicates an indenting of four sides of the sphere
which have the positions of the faces of a tetrahedron. The late
Professor Prinz of Brussels secured some extremely interesting
results in which he obtained intermediate forms with six angles,
but unfortunately these studies were not prepared for publication
at the time of his death.</p>

<p>The earth’s departure from the spheroid in the direction of the
modified tetrahedron is, as we have seen, no hypothesis, but observed
fact revealed in (1) the concentration of the land about
a central ocean in the northern hemisphere; in (2) the antipodal
relation of the land to the water areas, and in (3) the threefold
subdivision of the surface into north and south belts by the two
greater oceans and the Caspian Depression.</p>

<p><b>The earlier figures of the earth.</b>&mdash;The manner in which continent
and ocean are dovetailed into each other in an east-and-west
direction has been generally adduced as additional evidence for
the tetrahedral figure as above described. Closer examination
shows that instead of being in harmony with this figure, it indicates
a departure from it, and, as we shall see, a significant departure
which undoubtedly has its origin in the earlier history of
the planet. The mediterranean seas of both the eastern and the
western hemispheres likewise interfere with the perfection of the
tetrahedral figure and require an explanation.</p>

<p>Let us then examine in outline the past history of the world
with reference especially to the evolution of the continents and
to the times and the manners of surface change. It is now well
known that there have been three major periods of great deformation
of the earth’s shell. The first of these of which we have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
record came at the end of the first great era of geologic history,
the so-called Eozoic era; a second great transformation came at
the close of the second or Paleozoic era; and a third began at the
end of the next or Mesozoic era, an adjustment which is apparently
continuing to-day. Each of these great surface deformations was
accompanied by great volcanic eruptions of which we have the
evidence in the lavas remaining for our inspection, and each was
followed by the formation of great glaciers which spread over
large areas of the existing continents.</p>

<p>Before the earliest of these great changes, the earth appears to
have approximated in its figure somewhat closely to the ideal
spheroid, for it was everywhere enveloped in the hydrosphere as a
universal ocean. Toward the close of this period came the adjustments
which brought the lithosphere to protrude through the
hydrosphere in shield-like continents whose distribution, as shown
by the rocks of this period, is of great significance. Within the
northern hemisphere rose three land shields spaced at nearly
equal intervals and at nearly equal distances from the northern
pole. One of these was centered where now is Hudson Bay,
another about the present Baltic Sea, and the relics of the third
are found in northeastern Siberia. These earliest continents
have been referred to as the Laurentian, Baltic, and Angara shields.
Within the southern hemisphere shields appear to have developed
in somewhat similar grouping, namely, in South America, in South
Africa, and in Australia (<a href="#f3">Figs. 3</a> and <a href="#f5">5</a>).</p>

     <div class="caption"><p class="pc400"><span class="smcap">Fig. 5.</span>&mdash;Approximations to earlier and present figures of the earth.</p>
</div></div>

<p>These coigns or angles of a form into which the earlier spheroid
of the earth was being transformed have persisted through the
greater part of subsequent geologic time, and have been enlarged
by the growth of sediments about them as well as by the later<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
elevation and wrinkling of these deposits into marginal mountain
ranges.</p>


<p><b>The continents and oceans which arose at the close of the
Paleozoic era.</b>&mdash;At the close of the second great era in the recorded
history of the earth, the now somewhat enlarged continents were
profoundly altered during a series of convulsive movements within
the surface shell of the lithosphere. When these convulsions were
over, there was a new disposition of land and sea, but one quite
different from the present arrangement. Instead of being extended
in north-south belts, as they are at present, the continents
stretched out in broad east-west zones, one in the northern and
the other in the southern hemisphere. To the broad southern
continent of which so little now remains, the name “Gondwana
Land” has been given, and to the sea which divided the northern
from the southern continent the name “Ocean of Tethys.” The
northern continent stretched across the site of the present Atlantic
Ocean as the “North Atlantis”, its northern shore to the westward
being somewhat farther south than the present northern
coast of North America, since life forms migrated in the northern
ocean from the site of Behring Sea to that of the present
North Atlantic.</p>

<p>This arrangement of land and water during the middle period
of the earth’s recorded history, when considered with reference
both to its earlier and to its later evolution, may perhaps be best
accounted for by the assumption that the lithosphere was then
shaped like <a href="#f5">Fig. 5</a> (middle). In this figure two truncated tetrahedrons
are joined in a common plane of contact which may be
described as the twin plane. This medial depression upon the
lithosphere was occupied by the intercontinental sea, the Ocean of
Tethys.</p>

<p>Near the close of this second great era of the earth’s continental
history, crustal convulsions, which were perhaps the most
remarkable in the entire record, resulted in the almost complete
disappearance of the southern continent and a concentration of
the land within the northern hemisphere as a somewhat interrupted
belt surrounding a central polar ocean (<a href="#f3">Figs. 3</a> and <a href="#f5">5</a>).</p>

<p>Upon the assumption of twin tetrahedrons in the intermediate
era of continental evolution, both the Ocean of Tethys of that
time and its present remnants, the Caribbean and Mediterranean<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
seas, are accounted for. The <span class="font">V</span>-shaped continent extensions
and the <span class="font">A</span>-shaped oceans of the southern hemisphere (<a href="#f2">Fig. 2</a>) may
likewise be considered as relics of the now largely submerged tetrahedron
of the southern hemisphere, since this had its apex to the
northward (<a href="#f6">Fig. 6</a>).</p>

and the second at the north.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Thus we see that the lithosphere can scarcely be regarded as a
perfect spheroid, since in the course of geologic ages it has undergone
successive departures
from this
original form. In
its present state it
has been described
as tetrahedral,
though we must
keep in mind that
the sharp angles
of that figure are
deeply truncated.
The soundings
first by Nansen
and more recently
by Peary in the
Arctic basin, far
to the north of the
continental border,
showed that this depression is characterized by profound
depths, and so have afforded confirmation of the tetrahedral figure.
To match this depression at the northern extremity of the
earth’s axis, a high continent reaching to elevations in excess of
10,000 feet has been penetrated by Sir Ernest Shackleton at the
opposite extremity of this polar diameter. Considering its size
and its elevation, the Antarctic continent with its glacier mantle
is the largest protuberance upon the surface of the lithosphere.</p>

<p>In our study of the departures of the earth from the standard
spheroidal surface, we might even go a step farther and show how
the tetrahedron, which best represents the symmetry of the present
figure, is somewhat deformed by a flattening perpendicular to the
Pacific Ocean. To draw attention to this flattening of the earth,
it has sometimes been described as “potato-shaped”, since the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
outline perpendicular to this face is imperfectly heart-shaped or
like a flattened “peg top.”</p>

<p><b>The flooded portions of the present continents.</b>&mdash;We are accustomed
to think of the continents as ending at the shores of the
oceans. If, however, we
are to regard them as
platforms which rise
from the ocean depressions,
their margins
should be considerably
extended, for a submerged
shelf now practically
surrounds all the
continents to a nearly
uniform depth of 100
fathoms or 600 feet.
The oceans thus more than fill their basins and may be thought of
as spilling over upon the continents. In <a href="#f7">Fig. 7</a>, the submerged portions
of the continents have been joined to those usually represented,
thus adding about 10,000,000 square miles to their area, and giving
them one third, instead of one fourth, of the lithosphere surface.</p>

lithosphere surface.</p>
</div></div>

<p><b>The floors of the hydrosphere and atmosphere.</b>&mdash;The highest
altitudes upon the continents and the profoundest deeps of the
ocean are each removed about 30,000 feet, or nearly 6 miles,
from the level of the sea. In comparison with the entire surface
of the lithosphere, these extremes of elevation represent such
small areas as to be almost inappreciable. Only about <sup>1</sup>/<sub>80</sub> of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
lithosphere surface rises more than 6000 feet above sea level,
and about the same proportion lies deeper than 18,000 feet below
the same datum plane (<a href="#f8">Fig. 8</a>). Almost the entire area of the
lithosphere is included either in the so-called continental plateau
or platform, in the oceanic platform, or in the slope which separates
the two. The continental platform includes the continental shelf
above referred to, and represents about one third of the entire
area of the planet. This platform has a range of elevation from
6000 feet above to 600 feet below sea level and has an average
altitude of about 2300 feet. The oceanic platform slopes more
steeply, ranges in depth from 12,000 to 18,000 feet below sea level,
and comprises about one half the lithosphere surface. The
remaining portion of the surface, something less than one eighth
of all, is included in the steep slopes between the two platforms,
between 600 and 12,000 feet below sea. The two platforms and
the slope between them must not, however, be thought of as
continuous features upon the surface, but merely as representing
the average elevations of portions of the lithosphere.</p>

<p class="pch">THE NATURE OF THE MATERIALS IN THE LITHOSPHERE</p>

<p><b>The rigid quality of our planet.</b>&mdash;For a long time it was supposed
that the solid earth constituted a crust only which was
floated upon a liquid interior. This notion was clearly an outgrowth
of the then generally accepted Laplacian hypothesis of
the origin of the universe, which assumed fluid interiors for the
planets, the crust being suggested by the winter crust of frozen
water upon the surface of our inland lakes. To-day the nebular
hypothesis in the Laplacian form is fast giving place to quite
different conceptions, in which solid particles, and not gaseous
ones, are conceived to have built up the lithosphere. The analogy
with frozen water has likewise been abandoned with the discovery
that frozen rock, instead of floating, sinks in its molten equivalent.</p>

<p>Yet even more cogent arguments have been brought forward
to show that whatever may be the state of aggregation within the
earth’s core&mdash;and it may be different from any now known to
us&mdash;it nevertheless has many of the properties recognized as
belonging to solid and rigid bodies. Provisionally, therefore, we
may regard the earth’s core as rigid and essentially solid. It was
long ago pointed out by the late Lord Kelvin that if our lithosphere
were not more rigid than a ball of glass of the same size, it
would be constantly passing through periodic six-hourly distortions
of great amplitude in response to the varying attractions of the
moon. An equally striking argument emanating from the same
high authority is furnished by the well-known egg-spinning demonstration.
For illustration, Kelvin was accustomed to take two
eggs, one boiled and the other raw, and attempt to spin them
upon their ends. For the boiled, and essentially solid, egg this is
easily accomplished, but internal friction of the liquid contents of
the raw egg quickly stops any rotary motion which is imparted to
it. Upon the same grounds it is argued that had the earth’s
interior possessed the properties of a liquid, rotation must long
since have ceased.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>A stronger proof of earth rigidity than either of these has been
lately furnished by the instrumental study of earthquakes. With
the delicate apparatus which is now installed for the purpose,
heavy earthquakes may be sensed which have occurred anywhere
upon the earth’s surface, the earth movement sending its own
message by the shortest route through the core of the earth to the
observing station. A heavy shock which occurs in New Zealand
is recorded in England, almost diametrically opposite, in about
twenty-one minutes after its occurrence. The laws of wave
propagation and their relation to the properties of the transmitting
medium are well known, and in order to explain such extraordinary
velocity it is necessary to assume that for such impulses the earth’s
interior is much more rigid than the finest tool steel.</p>


<p><b>Probable composition of the earth’s core.</b>&mdash;In deriving views
concerning the nature of the earth’s interior we are greatly aided
by astronomical studies. The common origin long ago indicated
for the planets of the solar system and the sun has been confirmed
by the analysis of light with the aid of the spectroscope. It has
thus been found that the same chemical elements which we find in
the earth are present also in the sun and in the other stellar bodies.
Again, the group of planets of the solar system which are nearest
to the sun&mdash;Mercury, Venus, the Earth, and Mars&mdash;have each
a high density, all except Mars, the most distant, having specific
gravities very closely 5½, that of Mars being about 4. This
average specific gravity is also that of the solid bodies, the so-called
meteorites, which reach the surface of our planet from the surrounding
space. Yet though the earth as a whole is thus found
to have a specific gravity five and a half times that of water, its
surface shell has an average density of less than half this value,
or 2.7.</p>

<p>The study of meteorites has given us a possible clew to the
nature of the earth’s interior; for when both terrestrial and
celestial rock types are classified and placed in orderly arrangement,
it is found that the chemical elements which compose the
two groups are identical, and that these are united according to
the same physical and chemical laws. No new element has been
discovered in the one group that has not been found in the other,
and though some compounds of these elements, the minerals, occur
in the earth’s crust that have not been found in meteorites,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
and though some occur in meteorites which are not known from
the earth, yet of those which are common to both bodies there is
agreement, even to the minor details (<a href="#f9">Fig. 9</a>). It is found, however,
that the commonest of the minerals in the earth’s shell are
absent from meteorites, as the commoner constituents of meteorites
are wanting in the earth’s crust. This observation would go
far to show that we may in the two cases be examining different
portions of quite similar bodies; and this view is strikingly confirmed
when the rocks of the two groups are arranged in the order
of their densities (<a href="#f9">Fig. 9</a>).</p>

Ovifak, west Greenland; <i>a’-d’</i>, meteorites in order of density (after Judd).</p>
</div></div>

<p>In a broad way, density, structure, and chemical composition
are all similarly involved in the gradations illustrated by the
diagram; and it is significant that while there are terrestrial rocks
not represented by meteorites, the densest and the most unusual
of the terrestrial rocks are chemically almost identical with the
less dense of the celestial bodies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>


<p><b>The earth a magnet.</b>&mdash;The denser, and likewise the more
common, of the meteorite rocks&mdash;the so-called meteoric irons&mdash;are
composed almost entirely of the elements iron, nickel, and
cobalt. Such aggregates are not known as yet from terrestrial
sources, although transitional types appear to exist upon the
island of Disco off the west coast of Greenland. If it were possible
to explore the earth’s interior, would such combinations of
the iron minerals be encountered? Apart from the surprising
velocity of transmission of earthquake waves, the strongest argument
for an iron core to the lithosphere is found in the magnetic
property of the earth as a whole. The only magnetic elements
known to us are those of the heavy meteorites&mdash;iron, nickel,
and cobalt,&mdash;and the earth is, as we know, a great magnet whose
northern pole in British America and whose southern pole in
Antarctica have at last been visited by Amundsen and David,
respectively. The specific gravity of iron is 7.15, and those of
nickel and cobalt, which in the meteorites are present in relatively
small amounts, are 7.8 and 7.5, respectively. Considering that
the surface shell of the earth has a specific gravity of 2.7, these
values must be regarded as agreeing well with the determined
density of the earth (5.6) and the other planets of its group (Mercury
5.7, Venus 5.4, Mars 4).</p>


<p><b>The chemical constitution of the earth’s surface shell.</b>&mdash;The
number of the so-called chemical elements which enter into the
earth’s composition is more than eighty, but few of these figure
as important constituents of the portion known to us. Nearly
one half of the mass of this shell is oxygen, and more than a quarter
is silicon. The remaining quarter is largely made up of aluminium,
iron, calcium, magnesium, and the alkalies sodium and potassium,
in the order named. These eight constituent elements are thus
the only ones which play any important rôle in the composition
of the earth’s surface shell. They are not found there in the free
condition, but combined in the definite proportions characteristic
of chemical compounds, and as such they are known as <i>minerals</i>.</p>


<p><b>The essential nature of crystals.</b>&mdash;A crystal we are accustomed
to think of as something transparent bounded by sharp
edges and angles, our ideas having been obtained largely from the
gem minerals. This outward symmetry of form is, however, but
an expression of a power which resides, so to speak, in the heart<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
or soul of the crystal individual&mdash;it has its own structural make-up,
its individuality. No more correct estimates of the comparison
of crystal individualities would be obtained by the study of
outward forms alone of two minerals than would be gained by a
judgment of persons from the cut of their clothing. Too often
this outward dress tells only of the conditions by which both men
and crystals have been surrounded, and but little of the power
inherent in the individual. Many a battered mineral fragment
with little beauty to recommend it, when placed under suitable
conditions for its development, has grown into a marvel of beauty.
Few minerals are so mean that they have not within them this
inherent power of individuality which lifts them above the world
of the amorphous and shapeless.</p>

with an amorphous substance when expanded
by heat and when attacked by
acid.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Just as the real nature of a person is first disclosed by his
behavior under trying circumstances,
so of a crystal it is its
conduct under stress of one sort
or another which brings out
its real character. By way of
illustration let us prepare a
sphere from the mineral quartz&mdash;it
matters not whether we
destroy the beautiful outlines of
the crystal or employ a battered
fragment&mdash;and then prepare
a sphere of similar size and
shape from a noncrystalline or
amorphous substance like glass.
If now these two spheres be introduced
into a bath of oil and
raised to a higher temperature,
the glass globe undergoes an
enlargement without change of
its form; but the crystal ball
reveals its individuality by expanding
into a spheroid in
which each new dimension is nicely adjusted to this more complex
figure (<a href="#f10">Fig. 10</a>).</p>

<p>We may, instead of submitting the two balls to the “trial by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
fire”, allow each to be attacked by the powerful reagent, hydrofluoric
acid. The common glass under the attack of the acid
remains as it was before, a sphere, but with shrunken dimensions.
The crystal, on the other hand, is able to control the action of the
solvent, and in so doing its individuality is again revealed in a
beautifully etched figure having many curving outlines&mdash;it is as
though the crystal had possessed a soul which under this trial has
been revealed. This glimpse into the nature of the crystal, so as
to reveal its structural beauty, is still more surprising when the
crystal is taken from the acid in the
early stages of the action and held
close beneath the eye. Now the little
etchings upon the surface display
each the individuality of the substance,
and joining with their neighbors
they send out a beautifully
symmetrical and entirely characteristic
picture (<a href="#f11">Fig. 11</a>).</p>

<p><b>The lithosphere a complex of
interlocking crystals.</b>&mdash;To the layman the crystal is something rare
and expensive, to be obtained from
a jeweler or to be seen displayed in
the show cases of the great museums.
Yet the one most striking quality of the lithosphere which
separates it from the hydrosphere and the atmosphere is its crystalline
structure,&mdash;a structure belonging also to the meteorite, and
with little doubt to all the planets of the earth group. A snowflake
caught during its fall from the sky reveals all the delicate tracery
of crystal boundary; collected from a thick layer lying upon the
ground, it appears as an intricate aggregate of broken fragments
more or less firmly cemented together. And so it is of the lithosphere,
for the myriads of individuals are either the ruins of former
crystals, or they are grown together in such a manner that crystal
facets had no opportunity to develop.</p>

<p>Such mineral individuals as once possessed the crystal form may
have been broken and their surfaces ground away by mutual attrition
under the rhythmic beating of the waves upon a shore or in
the continuous rolling of pebbles on a stream bed, until as battered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
relics they are piled away together in a bed of sand. Yet
no amount of such rough handling is sufficient to destroy the crystal
individuality, and if they are now surrounded with conditions
which are suitable for their growth, their individual nature again
becomes revealed in new crystal outlines. Many of our sandstones
when turned in the bright sunlight send out flashes of light
to rival a bank of snow in early spring. These bright flashes
proceed from the facets of minute crystals formed about each
rounded grain of the sand, and if we examine them under a lens,
we may note the beauty of line formed with such exactness that
the most delicate instruments can detect no difference between
the similar angles of neighboring crystals (<a href="#f12">Fig. 12</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter">

a parallel growth about a single grain; <i>c</i>, growth of neighboring grains until they
have mutually interfered and so destroyed the crystal facets&mdash;the common condition
within the mass of a rock (after Irving and Van Hise).</p>
</div></div>

<p>This individual nature of the crystal is believed to reside in a
symmetrical grouping of the chemical molecules of the substance
into larger and so-called “crystal molecules.” The crystal quality
belongs to the chemical elements and to their compounds in the
solid condition, but not to ordinary mixtures of them.</p>


<p><b>Some properties of natural crystals, minerals.</b>&mdash;No two mineral
species appear in crystals of the same appearance, any more
than two animal species have been given the same form; and so
minerals may be recognized by the individual peculiarities of their
crystals. Yet for the reason that crystals have so generally been
prevented from developing or retaining their characteristic faces,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
in the vast number of instances it is the behavior, and not the
appearance, of the mineral substance which is made use of for identification.</p>

<p>When a mineral is broken under the blow of a hammer, instead
of yielding an irregular fracture, like that of glass, it generally
tends to part along one or more directions so as to leave plane
surfaces. This property of <i>cleavage</i> is strikingly illustrated for
a single direction in the mineral mica, for two directions in feldspar,
and for three directions in calcite or Iceland spar. Other
properties of minerals, such as hardness, specific gravity, luster,
color, fusibility, etc., are all made use of in rough determinations
of the minerals. Far more delicate methods depend upon the
behavior of minerals when observed in polarized light, and such
behavior is the basis of those branches of geological science known
as optical mineralogy and as microscopical petrography. An outline
description of some of the common minerals and the means
for identifying them will be found in appendix A.</p>


<p><b>The alterations of minerals.</b>&mdash;By far the larger number of
minerals have been formed in the cooling and consequent consolidation
of molten rock material such as during a volcanic eruption
reaches the earth’s surface as lava. Beginning their growth
at many points within the viscous mass, the individual crystals
eventually may grow together and so prevent a development of
their crystal faces.</p>

<p>Another class of minerals are deposited from solution in water
within the cavities and fissures of the rocks; and if this process
ceases before the cavities have been completely closed, the minerals
are found projecting from the walls in a beautiful lining of crystal&mdash;the
<i>Krystallkeller</i> or “crystal cellar.” It is from such
pockets or veins within the rocks that the valuable ores are obtained,
as are the crystals which are displayed in our mineral
cabinets.</p>

</div></div>

<p>There is, however, a third process by which minerals are formed,
and minerals of this class are produced within the solid rock as
a product of the alteration of preëxisting minerals. Under the
enormous pressures of the rocks deep below the earth’s surface,
they are as permeable to the percolating waters as is a sponge
at the surface. Under these conditions certain minerals are
dissolved and their material redeposited after traveling in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
solution, or solution and redeposition of mineral matter may go
on together within the mass of the same rock. One new mineral
may have been produced from the dissolved materials of a number
of earlier species, or several new minerals may
be the result of the alteration of a preëxisting mineral
with a more complex chemical structure. Where
the new mineral has been formed “in place”, it has
sometimes been able to utilize the materials of all
the minerals which before existed there, or it may
have been obliged to inclose within itself those earlier
constituents which it could not assimilate in its own
structure (<a href="#f13">Fig. 13</a>).</p>

</div></div>

<p>At other times a crystal which is imbedded in
rock has been attacked upon its surface by the percolating
solutions, and the dissolved
materials have been deposited in place
as a crown of new minerals which steadily widens its
zone until the center is reached and the original
crystal has been entirely transformed (<a href="#f14">Fig. 14</a>). It
is sometimes possible to say
that the action by which
these changes have been
brought about has involved
a nice adjustment of supply
of the chemical constituents
necessary to the formation
of the new mineral or minerals.
In rocks which are
aggregates of several mineral
species, a newly formed
mineral may appear only at
the common margin of certain
of these species, thus showing that
they supply those chemical elements which
were necessary to the formation of the
new substance (<a href="#f15">Fig. 15</a>). Thus it is seen
that below the earth’s surface chemical reactions are constantly
going on, and the earlier rocks are thus locally being transformed
into others of a different mineral constitution.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>Near the earth’s surface the carbon dioxide and the moisture
which are present in the atmosphere are constantly changing
the exposed portions of the lithosphere into carbonates, hydrates,
and oxides. These compounds are more soluble than are the
minerals out of which they were formed, and they are also more
bulky and so tend to crack off from the parent mass on which
they were formed. As we are to see, for both of these reasons
the surface rocks of the lithosphere succumb to this attack from
the atmosphere.</p>

<p>In connection with those wrinklings of the surface shell of the
lithosphere from which mountains result, the underlying rocks
are subjected to great strains, and even where no visible partings
are produced, the rocks are deformed so that individual minerals
may be bent into crescent-shaped or <span class="font">S</span>-shaped forms, or they are
parted into one or more fragments which remain imbedded within
the rock.</p>

<p class="pch">THE ROCKS OF THE EARTH’S SURFACE SHELL</p>

<p><b>The processes by which rocks are formed.</b>&mdash;Rocks may be
formed in any one of several ways. When a portion of the molten
lithosphere, so-called <i>magma</i>, cools and consolidates, the product
is <i>igneous</i> rock. Either igneous or other rock may become disintegrated
at the earth’s surface, and after more or less extended
travel, either in the air, in water, or in ice, be laid down as a sediment.
Such sediments, whether cemented into a coherent mass
or not, are described as <i>sedimentary</i> or <i>clastic</i> rocks. If the fluid
from which they were deposited was the atmosphere, they are
known as <i>subaërial</i> or <i>eolian</i> sediments; but if water, they are
known as <i>subaqueous</i> deposits. Still another class are ice-deposited
and are known as <i>glacial</i> deposits.</p>

<div class="floatleft">
     <img src="images/ill-069.jpg" width="250" height="168" id="f16"

     <div class="cf"><p class="ch250"><span class="smcap">Fig. 16.</span>&mdash;Laminated structure of sedimentary rock,
Western Kansas (after a photograph by E. S.
Tucker).</p>
</div></div>

<p>But, as we have learned, rocks may undergo transformations
through mineral alteration, in which case they are known as
<i>metamorphic</i> rocks.
When these changes
consist chiefly in the
production of more
soluble minerals at
the surface, accompanied
by thorough
disintegration, due
to the direct attack
of the atmosphere,
the resulting rocks
are called <i>residual</i>
rocks.</p>

<p><b>The marks of origin.</b>&mdash;Each
of the
three great classes of rocks, the igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic,
is characterized by both coarser and finer structures, in
the examination of which they may be identified. The igneous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
rocks having been produced from magmas, which are essentially
homogeneous, are usually without definite directional structures
due to an arrangement of their constituents, and are said to have
a <i>massive</i> structure. Sedimentary rocks, upon the other hand,
have been formed by an assorting process, the larger and heavier
fragments having been laid down when there was high velocity of
either wind or water current, and the smaller and lighter fragments
during intermediate periods. They are therefore more or
less banded, and are said to have a <i>bedded</i> or <i>laminated</i> structure
(<a href="#f16">Fig. 16</a>).</p>

<p>Again, igneous rocks, being due to a process of crystallization,
are composed of mineral individuals which are bounded either
by crystal planes or by irregular surfaces along which neighboring
crystals have interfered with each other; but in either case the
grains possess sharply angular boundaries. Quite different has
been the result of the attrition between grains in the transportation
and deposition of sediments, for it is characteristic of the
sedimentary rocks that their constituent grains are well rounded.
Eolian sediments have usually more perfectly rounded grains than
subaqueous deposits.</p>

<p>Glacial deposits, if laid down directly by the ice, are unstratified,
relatively coarse, and contain pebbles which are both faceted
and striated. Such deposits are described as till or tillite. If
glacier-derived material is taken up by the streams of thaw
water and is by them redeposited, the sediments are assorted
or stratified, and they are described as <i>fluvio-glacial</i> deposits.</p>


<p><b>The metamorphic rocks.</b>&mdash;Both the coarser structures and
the finer textures of the metamorphic rocks are intermediate
between those of the igneous and the sedimentary classes. A
metamorphosed sedimentary rock, in proportion to its alteration,
loses the perfect lamination and the rounded grain which were
its distinguishing characters; while an igneous rock takes on in
the process an imperfect banding, and the sharp angles of its
constituent grains become rounded off by a sort of peripheral
crushing or granulation. Metamorphic rocks are therefore
characterized by an imperfectly banded structure described as
<i>schistosity</i> or <i>gneiss banding</i>, and the constituent grains may be
either angular or rounded. If the metamorphism has not been
too intense or too long continued, it is generally possible to determine,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
particularly with the aid of the polarizing microscope,
whether the original rock from which it was derived was of igneous
or of sedimentary origin. There are, however, many examples
which have defied a reliable verdict concerning their origin.</p>


<p><b>Characteristic textures of the igneous rocks.</b>&mdash;In addition to
the massiveness of their general aspect and the angular boundaries
of their constituents, there are many additional textures
which are characteristic of the igneous rocks. While those that
have consolidated below the earth’s surface, the <i>intrusive</i> rocks,
are notably compact, the magmas which arrive at the surface of
the lithosphere before their consolidation reveal special structures
dependent either upon the expansion of steam and other gases
within them, or upon the conditions of flow over the earth’s surface.
Magmas which thus reach the surface of the earth are described
as <i>lavas</i>, and the rocks produced by their consolidation
are <i>extrusive</i> or <i>volcanic</i> rocks. The steam included in the lava
expands into bubbles or vesicles which may be large or small,
few or many. According to the number and the size of these
cavities, the rock is said to have a <i>vesicular</i>, <i>scoriaceous</i>, or <i>pumiceous</i>
texture.</p>

<p>Most lavas, when they arrive at the earth’s surface, contain
crystals which are more or less disseminated throughout the
molten mass. The tourist who visits Mount Vesuvius at the time
of a light eruption may thrust his staff into the stream of lava
and extract a portion of the viscous substance in which are seen
beautiful white crystals of the mineral leucite, each bounded by
twenty-four crystal faces. It is clear that these crystals must
have developed by a slow growth within the magma while it was
still below the surface, and when the inclosing lava has consolidated,
these earlier crystals lie scattered within a <i>groundmass</i>
of glassy or minutely crystalline material. This scattering of
crystals belonging to an earlier generation within a groundmass
due to later consolidation is thus an indication of interruption in
the process of crystallization, and the texture which results is
described as <i>porphyritic</i> (<a href="#f17">Fig. 17 <i>b</i></a>). Should the lava arrive at
the surface before any crystals have been generated and consolidate
rapidly as a rock glass, its texture is described as <i>glassy</i>
(<a href="#f17">Fig. 17 <i>c</i></a>).</p>

<p>When the crystals of the earlier generation are numerous and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
needle-like in form, as is very often the case, they arrange themselves
“end on” during the rock flow, so that when consolidation
has occurred, the rock has a kind of puckered lamination which
is the characteristic of the <i>fluxion</i> or <i>flow</i> texture. This texture
has sometimes been confused with the lamination of the sedimentary
rocks, so that wrong conclusions have been reached
regarding origin. At other times the same needle-like crystals
within the lava have grouped themselves radially to form rounded
nodules called spherulites. Such nodules give to the rock a
<i>spherulitic</i> texture, which is nowhere better displayed than in the
beautiful glassy lavas of Obsidian Cliff in the Yellowstone National
Park.</p>

<p>Winds are under favorable conditions capable of transporting
both dust and sand, but not the larger rock fragments. The dust
deposits are found accumulating outside the borders of deserts
as the so-called <i>loess</i> (<a href="#f216">Fig. 216</a>), though the sand is never
carried beyond the desert border, near which it collects in wide
belts of ridges described as dunes. When this sand has been
cemented into a coherent mass, it is known as eolian sandstone.
A section of the appendix (B) is devoted to an outline description
of some of the commoner rock types.</p>


<p><b>The different deposits of ocean, lake, and river.</b>&mdash;Of the subaqueous
sediments, there are three distinct types resulting:
(1) from sedimentation in rivers, the <i>fluviatile</i> deposits; (2) from
sedimentation in lakes, the <i>lacustrine</i> deposits; and (3) from sedimentation
in the ocean, <i>marine</i> deposits. Again, the widest
range of character is displayed by the deposits which are laid
down in the different parts of the course of a stream. Near the
source of a river, coarse river gravels may be found; in the middle
course the finer silts; and in the mouth or delta region, where the
deposits enter the sea or a lake, there is found an assortment of
silts and clays. Except within the delta region, where the area
of deposition begins to broaden, the deposits of rivers are stretched
out in long and relatively narrow zones, and are so distinguished
from the far more important lacustrine and marine deposits.</p>

<p>Lakes and oceans have this in common that both are bodies
of standing as contrasted with flowing water; and both are subject
to the periodical rhythmic motions and alongshore currents
due to the waves raised by the wind. About their margins, the
deposits of lake and ocean are thus in large part wrested by the
waves from the neighboring land. Their distribution is always
such that the coarsest materials are laid down nearest to the shore,
and the deposits become ever finer in the direction of deeper
water. Relatively far from shore may be found the finest sands
and muds or calcareous deposits, while near the shore are sands,
and, finally, along the beach, beds of beach pebbles or shingle.
When cemented into coherent rocks, these deposits become shales
or limestones, sandstones, and conglomerates, respectively.</p>

<p>As regards the limestones, their origin is involved in considerable
uncertainty. Some, like the shell limestone or coquina
of the Florida coast, are an aggregation of remains of mollusks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
which live near the border of the sea. Other limestones are deposited
directly from carbonate of lime in solution in the water.
A deposit of this nature is forming in southern Florida, both as
a flocculent calcareous mud and as crystals of lime carbonate
upon a limestone surface. Again, there is the reef limestone
which is built up of the stony parts of the coral animal, and,
lastly, the calcareous ooze of the deep-sea deposits.</p>

<p>The marine sediments which are derived from the continents,
the so-called <i>terrigenous</i> deposits, are found only upon the
continental shelf and upon the continental slope just outside it.
Of these terrigenous deposits, it is customary to distinguish:
(1) <i>littoral</i> or alongshore deposits, which are laid down between
high and low tide levels; (2) <i>shoal water</i> deposits, which are found
between low-water mark and the edge of the continental shelf; and
(3) aktian or offshore deposits, which are found upon the continental
slope. The littoral and shoal water deposits are mainly
gravels and sands, while the offshore deposits are principally
muds or lime deposits.</p>


<p><b>Special marks of littoral deposits.</b>&mdash;The marks of ripples are
often left in the sand of a beach, and may be preserved in the sandstone
which results from the cementation of such deposits (pl. 11 A).
Very similar markings are, however, quite characteristic of the
surface of wind-blown sand. For the reason that deposits are
subject to many vicissitudes in their subsequent history, so that
they sometimes stand at steep angles or are even overturned,
it is important to observe the curves of sand ripples so as to distinguish
the upper from the lower surface.</p>

<p>In the finer sands and muds of sheltered tidal flats may be preserved
the impressions from raindrops or of the feet of animals
which have wandered over the flat during an ebb tide. When
the tide is at flood, new material is laid down upon the surface
and the impressions are filled, but though hardened into rock,
these surfaces are those upon which the rock is easily parted,
and so the impressions are preserved. In the sandstones of the
Connecticut valley there has been preserved a quite remarkable
record in the footprints of animals belonging to extinct species,
which at the time these deposits were laid down must have been
abundant upon the neighboring shores.</p>

<p>Between the tides muds may dry out and crack in intersecting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
lines like the walls of a honeycomb, and when the cracks have been
filled at high tide, a structure is produced which may later be
recognized and is usually referred to as “mud-crack” structure.
This structure is of special service in distinguishing marine deposits
from the subaërial or continental deposits.</p>

<p>A variation in the direction of winds of successive storms
may be responsible for the piling up of the beach sand in a peculiar
“plunge and flow” or “cross-bedded” structure, a structure
which is extremely common in littoral deposits, though simulated
in rocks of eolian origin.</p>


<p><b>The order of deposition during a transgression of the sea.</b>&mdash;Many
shore lines of the continents are almost constantly migrating
either landward or seaward. When the shore line advances
over the land, the coast is sinking, and marine deposits will be
formed directly above what was recently the “dry land.” Such
an invasion of the land by the sea, due to a subsidence of the coast,
is called a transgression of the sea, or simply a <i>transgression</i>.
Though at any moment the littoral, shoal water, and offshore
deposits are each being laid down in a particular zone, it is evident
that each must advance in turn in the direction of the shore
and so be deposited above the zones nearer shore. Thus there
comes to be a definite series of continuous beds, one above the other,
provided only that the process is continued (<a href="#f18">Fig. 18</a>). At the
very bottom of this series there will usually be found a thin bed
of pebbly beach materials, which later will harden into the so-called
<i>basal conglomerate</i>. If the size of the pebbles is such as to
make possible an identification, it will generally be found that these
represent the ruins of the rock over which the sea has advanced
upon the land.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

     <div class="caption"><p class="pc400"><span class="smcap">Fig. 18.</span>&mdash;Diagram to show the order of the sediments laid down during a transgression
of the sea.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Next in order above the basal conglomerate, will follow the
coarser and then the finer sands, upon which in turn will be laid
down the offshore sediments&mdash;the muds and the lime deposits.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
Later, when cemented together, these become in order, coarser
and finer sandstones, shales, and limestones. The order of superposition,
reading from the bottom to the top, thus gives the order
of decreasing age of the formations.</p>

<p>A subsequent uplift of the coast will be accompanied by a
recession of the sea, and when later dissected by nature for our
inspection, the order of superposition and the individual character
of each of the deposits may be studied at leisure. From such
studies it has been found that along with the inorganic deposits
there are often found the remains of life in the hard parts of such
invertebrate animals as the mollusks and the crustacea. These
so-called <i>fossils</i> represent animals which were gradually developed
from simpler to more and more complex forms; and they thus
serve the purpose of successive page numbers in arranging the
order of disturbed strata, at the same time that they supply
the most secure foundation upon which rests the great doctrine
of evolution.</p>


<p><b>The basins of earlier ages.</b>&mdash;It was the great Viennese geologist,
Professor Suess, who first pointed out that in mountain regions
there are found the thickest and the most complete series of the
marine deposits; whereas outside these provinces the formations
are separated by wide gaps representing periods when no
deposits were laid down because the sea had retired from the
region. The completeness of the series of deposits in the mountain
districts can only be interpreted to mean that where these but
lately formed mountains rise to-day, were for long preceding ages
the basins for deposition of terrigenous sediments. It would
seem that the lithosphere in its adjustment had selected these
earlier sea basins with their heavy layers of sediment for zones of
special uplift.</p>


<p><b>The deposits of the deep sea.</b>&mdash;Outside the continental slope,
whose base marks the limit of the terrigenous deposits, lies the
deeper sea, for the most part a series of broad plains, but varied by
more profound steep-walled basins, the so-called “deeps” of the
ocean. As shown by the dredgings of the <i>Challenger</i> expedition
and others of more recent date, the deposits upon the ocean
floor are of a wholly different character from those which are
derived from the continents. Except in the great deeps, or
between depths of five hundred and fifteen hundred fathoms,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
these deposits are the so-called “ooze”, composed of the calcareous
or chitinous parts of algæ and of minute animal organisms.
The pelagic or surface waters of the ocean are, as it were, a great
meadow of these plant forms, upon which the minute crustacea,
such as globigerina, foraminifera, and the pteropods, feed in countless
myriads. The hard parts of both plant and animal organisms
descend to the bottom and there form the ooze in which are sometimes
found the ear bones of whales and the teeth of sharks.</p>

<p>In the deeps of the ocean, none of these vegetable or animal
deposits are being laid down, but only the so-called “red clay”,
which is believed to represent decomposed volcanic material
deposited by the winds as fine dust on the surface of the ocean, or
the product of submarine volcanic eruption. From the absence
of the ooze in these profound depths, the conclusion is forced upon
us that the hard parts of the minute organisms are dissolved while
falling through three or four miles of the ocean water.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<p class="pch">CONTORTIONS OF THE STRATA WITHIN THE ZONE OF
FLOW</p>


<p><b>The zones of fracture and flow.</b>&mdash;It is easy to think of the
atmosphere and the hydrosphere as each sustaining at any point
the load of the superincumbent material. At the sea level the
weight of air upon each square inch of surface is about fifteen
pounds, whereas upon the floor of the hydrosphere in the more
profound deeps the load upon the square inch must be measured
in tons. Near the lithosphere surface the rocks support by their
strength the load of rock above them, but at greater depths they
are unable to do this, for the load bears upon each portion
of the rock with a pressure equivalent to the weight of a rock
column which extends upward to the surface. The average
specific gravity of rock is 2.7, and it is thus easy to calculate the
length of the inch square column which has a weight equivalent
to the crushing strength of any given rock. At the depth represented
by the length of such a column, rocks cannot yield to pressure
by fracture, for the opening of a crack implies that the rock
upon either side is strong enough to prevent the walls from closing.
At this depth, rock must therefore yield to pressure not by
fracture, as it would at the surface, but by flow after the manner
of a liquid; and so the zone below this critical level is referred to
as the <i>zone of flow</i>.</p>

<div class="floatright">

     <div class="cf"><p class="ch200"><span class="smcap">Fig. 19.</span>&mdash;Two intersecting
parallel series
of fractures produced
upon each free surface
of a prismatic
block of stiff molders’
wax when broken by
compression from the
ends (after Daubrée
and Tresca).</p>
</div></div>

<p>In contrast, the near-surface zone is called the <i>zone of fracture</i>.
But different rocks possess different strengths, and these are
subject to modifications from other conditions, such, for example,
as the proximity of an uncooled magma. The zone of flow is
therefore joined to the zone of fracture, not upon a definite surface,
but in an intermediate zone described as the <i>zone of fracture and
flow</i>.</p>


<p><b>Experiments which illustrate the fracture and flow of solid
bodies.</b>&mdash;A prismatic block prepared from stiff molders’ wax,
if crushed between the jaws of a testing machine, yields a system<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
of intersecting fractures which are perpendicular to the free surfaces
of the block and take two directions each inclined by half
of a right angle to the direction of compression
(<a href="#f19">Fig. 19</a>). This experiment may illustrate the
manner in which fractures are produced by
the compression within the zone of fracture
of the lithosphere, as its core continues to
contract.</p>

<p>To reproduce the conditions within the zone
of flow, it will be necessary to load the lateral
surfaces of the block instead of leaving them
unconstrained as in the above-described experiment.
The experiment is best devised as
in <a href="#f20">Fig. 20</a>. Here a series of layers having
varying degrees of rigidity is prepared from
beeswax as a base, either stiffened by admixture
of varying proportions of plaster of
Paris, or weakened by the use of Venice turpentine.
Such a series of layers may represent
rocks of as widely different characters as limestone
and shale. The load which is to represent
superincumbent rock is supplied in the
experiment by a deep layer of shot.</p>

(after Willis).</p>
</div></div>

<p>When compression is applied to the layers
from the ends, these normally solid materials,
instead of fracturing, are bent into a series
of folds. The stiffer, or more competent, layers are found to be
less contorted than are the weaker layers, particularly if the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
latter have been protected under an arch of the more competent
layer (pl. 2 A).</p>


<p><b>The arches and troughs of the folded strata.</b>&mdash;Every series
of folds is made up of alternating arches and troughs. The arches
of the strata the geologist calls <i>anticlines</i> or <i>anticlinal folds</i>, and
the troughs he calls <i>synclines</i> or <i>synclinal folds</i> (<a href="#f21">Fig. 21</a>). When a
stratum is merely dropped in a
bend to a lower level without
producing a complete arch or a
complete trough, this half fold
is termed a <i>monocline</i>.</p>

</div></div>

<p>Any flexuring of the strata
implies a reduction of their
surface area, or, considering a
single section, a shortening. If the arches and troughs are low
and broad, the deformation of the strata is slight, the shortening
is comparatively small, and the folds are described as <i>open</i>
(<a href="#f22">Fig. 22 <i>b</i></a>). If they be relatively both
high and narrow, the deformation is
considerable, a larger amount of crustal
shortening has gone on, and the folds
are described as <i>close</i> (<a href="#f22">Fig. 22 <i>c</i></a>). This
closing up of the folds may continue
until their sides have practically the
same slope, in which case they are said
to be <i>isoclinal</i> (<a href="#f22">Fig. 22 <i>d</i></a>).</p>

open folds; <i>c</i>, close folds;
<i>d</i>, isoclinal folds.</p>
</div></div>

<p><b>The elements of folds.</b>&mdash;Folds must
always be thought of as having extension
in each of the three dimensions
of space (<a href="#f23">Fig. 23</a>), and not as properly
included within a single plane like the
cross sections which we so often use in
illustration. A fold may be conceived
of as divided into equal parts by a plane
which passes along the middle of either the arch or the trough,
and is called the <i>axial plane</i>. The line in which this plane intersects
the arch or the trough is the <i>axis</i>, which may be called the
<i>crestline</i> in an anticline, and the <i>troughline</i> in a syncline.</p>

<p>In the case of many open folds the axis is practically horizontal,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
but in more complexly folded regions this is seldom true.
The departure of the axis from the horizontal is called the <i>pitch</i>,
and folds of this type are described as <i>pitching folds</i> or <i>plunging
folds</i>. The axis is in reality in these cases thrown into a series
of undulations or “longitudinal folds”, and hence pitch will
vary along the axis.</p>

the different shapes of rock folds.</p>
</div></div>

<p><b>The shapes of rock folds.</b>&mdash;By the axial plane each fold is
divided into two parts which are called its <i>limbs</i>, which may have
either the same or different average inclinations. To describe
now the shapes of rock folds and not the degree of compression of
the district, some additional terms are necessary. Anticlines
or synclines whose limbs have about the same inclinations are
known as <i>upright</i> or <i>symmetrical folds</i>. The axial plane of the
symmetrical fold is vertical (<a href="#f24">Fig. 24</a>). If this plane is inclined to
the vertical, the folds are <i>unsymmetrical</i>. So soon as the steeper
of the two limbs has passed the vertical position and inclines in
the same direction as the flatter limb, the fold is said to be <i>overturned</i>.
The departure from symmetry may go so far that the
axial plane of the fold lies at a very flat angle, and the fold is then
said to be <i>recumbent</i>. The observant traveler by train along any
of the routes which enter the Alps may from his car window find
illustrations of most of these types of rock folds, as he may also,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
though generally less easily, in passing through the Appalachian
Mountains.</p>

<p>In regions which have been closely
folded the larger flexures of the strata
may be found with folds of a smaller
order of magnitude superimposed
upon them, and these in turn may
show crumplings of still lower orders.
It has been found that the folds of
the smaller orders of magnitude possess
the shapes of the larger flexures,
and much is therefore to be learned
from their careful study (<a href="#f25">Fig. 25</a>).
It is also quite generally discovered
that parallel planes of ready parting,
which are described as <i>rock cleavage</i>,
take their course parallel to the axial
plane within each minor fold. As
was long ago shown by the pioneer
British geologists, these planes of
cleavage are essentially parallel and
follow the fold axes throughout large
areas.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p><b>The overthrust fold.</b>&mdash;Whenever
a stratum is bent, there is a tendency for its particles to be
separated upon the convex side of the bend, at the same time
that those upon the concave
side are crowded
closer together&mdash;there
is tension in the former
case and compression
in the latter (<a href="#f26">Fig. 26</a>).
Within an unsymmetrical
or an overturned
fold, the peculiar distortions
in the different
sections of the stratum
are less simple and are
best illustrated by
<a href="#p2c">pl. 2 C</a>. This apparatus shows two similar piles of paper sheets,
upon the edges of each of which a series of circles has been drawn.
When now one of the piles is bent into an unsymmetrical fold, it
is seen that through an accommodation by the paper sheets sliding
each over its neighbor large distortions of the circles have occurred.
In that steeper limb which with closer folding will be overturned
the circles have been drawn
out into long and narrow
ellipses, and this indicates
that those rock particles
which before the bending
were included in the circle
have been moved past each
other in the manner of the
blades of a pair of shears.
Such extreme “shearing” action is thus localized in the underturned
limb of the fold, and a time must come with continuation
of the compression when the fold will rupture at this critical place
along a plane parallel to the longest axis of the ellipses or nearly
parallel to the axial plane of the anticline. Such structures probably
occur in the zone of combined fracture and flow, up into
which the beds are forced in cases of close compression. Relief
thus being found upon this plane of fracture, the upper portion
of the fold will now ride over the lower, and the displacement is
described as a <i>thrust</i> or <i>overthrust</i>.</p>

concave side (after Van Hise).</p>
</div></div>

<p>In the long series of experiments conducted by Mr. Bailey
Willis of the United States Geological Survey, all the stages between
the overturned fold and the overthrust fold were reproduced.
Where a series of folds was closely compressed, a parallel series of
thrusts developed (<a href="#p2b">pl. 2 B</a>), so that a series of slices cutting across
neighboring strata was slid in succession, each over the other,
like the scales upon a fish or the shingles upon a roof. Quite
remarkable structures of this kind have been discovered in rocks
of such closely folded districts as the Northwest Highlands of Scotland,
where the overriding is measured in miles. Near the thrust
planes the rocks show a crushing of the grains, and the planes themselves
are sometimes corrugated and polished by the movement.</p>


<p><b>Restoration of mutilated folds.</b>&mdash;Since flexuring of the rocks
takes place within the zone of flow at a distance of several miles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
below the earth’s surface, it is quite obvious that the results of the
process can be studied only after some thousands of feet of superincumbent
strata have been removed. We are a little later to see
by what processes this lowering of the surface is accomplished,
but for the present it may be sufficient to accept the fact, realizing
that before foldings in the strata can reach the surface, they must
have passed through the upper zone of fracture.</p>

<p>It might perhaps be supposed that the anticlines would appear
as the mountains upon the surface, and occasionally this is true;
as, for example, in the folded Jura Mountains of western Europe.
More generally, the mountains have a synclinal structure and the
valleys an anticlinal one; but as no general rule can be applied,
it is necessary to make a restoration of the truncated folds in each
district before their character can be known.</p>


<p><b>The geological map and section.</b>&mdash;The earth’s surface is in
most regions in large part covered with soil or with other incoherent
rock material, so that over considerable areas the hard rocks
are hidden from view. Each locality at which the rock is found
at the earth’s surface “in place” is described as an <i>outcropping</i>
or <i>exposure</i>. In a study of the region each such exposure must
be examined to determine the nature of the rock, especially for
the purpose of correlation with neighboring exposures, and, in
addition, both the probable direction in which it is continued along
the surface&mdash;the <i>strike</i>&mdash;and the inclination of its beds&mdash;the
<i>dip</i>. If the outcroppings are sufficiently numerous, and rock
type, strike and dip, may all be determined, the folds of the district
may be restored with almost as much accuracy as though
their curves were everywhere exposed to view. A cross section
through the surface which represents the observed outcrops with
their inclinations and the assumed intermediate strata in their
probable attitudes is described as a <i>geological section</i> (<a href="#f27">Fig. 27</a>). A
map upon which the data have been entered in their correct locations,
either with or without assumptions concerning the covered
areas, is known as a <i>geological map</i>.</p>

     <div class="caption"><p class="pc400"><span class="smcap">Fig. 27.</span>&mdash;A geological section based upon observations at outcrops, but with

</div></div>

<p>If the axes of folds are absolutely horizontal, and the surface
of the earth be represented as a plain, the lines of intersection of
the truncated strata with the ground, or with any horizontal surface,
will give the directions of continuation of the individual
strata. This strike direction is usually determined at each exposure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
by use of a compass provided with a spirit level. When that
edge of the leveled compass which is parallel to the north-south
line upon the dial is held against the sloping rock stratum, the
angle of strike is measured in degrees by the compass needle. If
the cardinal directions have been placed in their correct positions
upon the compass dial, the needle will point to the northwest
when the strike is northeast, and <i>vice versa</i> (<a href="#f28">Fig. 28 <i>a</i></a>). Upon
the geologist’s compass it is therefore customary to reverse the
initials which represent the east and west directions, in order that
the correct strike may be read directly from the dial (<a href="#f28">Fig. 28 <i>b</i></a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div></div>

<p>By the dip is meant the inclination of the stratum at any exposure,
and this must obviously be measured in a vertical plane<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
along the steepest line in the bedding plane. The dip angle is
always referred to a horizontal plane, and hence vertical beds have
a dip of 90°. The device for measuring this angle of dip, the
<i>clinometer</i>, is merely a simple pendulum which serves as an indicator
and is centered at the corner of a graduated quadrant. A
home-made variety is easily constructed from a square piece of
board and an attached paper quadrant (<a href="#f28">Fig. 28 <i>c</i></a>), but the geologist’s
compass is always provided with a clinometer attachment
to the dial.</p>

of <span class="font reduct">T</span> symbols to indicate the dip and
strike of outcroppings.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Since the strike is the intersection of the bedding plane with a
horizontal surface, and the dip is the intersection with that particular
vertical plane which gives the steepest inclination, the strike
and dip are perpendicular to each other. To represent them
upon maps, it is more or less customary to use the so-called <span class="font">T</span>
symbols, the top of the <span class="font">T</span> giving the direction of the strike and the
shank that of the dip. If meridians are drawn upon the map, the
direction or attitude of the <span class="font">T</span> can be found by the use of a simple
protractor; and when entered upon the map, the exact angle of
the strike may be supplied by a figure near the top of the T, and
the dip angle by a figure at the end of the shank. It is the custom,
also, to make the length of the shank inversely proportional to
the steepness of the dip, so that in a broad way the attitudes of
the strata may be taken in at a glance (<a href="#f29">Fig. 29</a>). It is further of
advantage to make the top of the
T a double line, so that some
symbol or color may show the
correlations of the different exposures.
To illustrate, in <a href="#f29">Fig. 29</a>,
the symbol marked <i>a</i> represents
an outcrop of limestone, the strike
of which is 50° east of north (N.
50° E.), and the dip of which is
45° southeast. In the same figure
<i>b</i> represents a shale outcrop in horizontal
beds, which have in consequence
a universal strike and a dip of 0°. An exposure of limestone
in vertical beds which strike N. 60° E. is shown at <i>c</i>, etc.</p>

<p><b>Measurement of the thickness of formations.</b>&mdash;When formations
still lie in horizontal beds, we may sometimes learn their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
thickness directly either from the depth of borings to the underlying
rock, or by measurements upon steep cañon walls. If the
beds stand vertically, the matter is exceedingly simple, for in this
case the thickness is the width of the outcrops of the formation
between the beds which bound it upon either side. In the general
case, in which the beds are
neither horizontal nor vertical,
the thickness must be
obtained indirectly from the
width of the exposures and
the angle of the dip. The
factor by which the exposure
width must be multiplied
is known as the sine
of the dip angle (<a href="#f30">Fig. 30</a>),
which is given with sufficient
accuracy for most purposes
in the following table. It is obvious that in order to obtain
the full thickness of a formation it is necessary to measure from
the contact with the adjacent formation upon the one side to a
similar contact with the nearest formation upon the other.</p>

</div></div>

<p><b>The detection of plunging folds.</b>&mdash;When the axis of a fold is
horizontal, its outcrops upon a plain will continue to have the same
strike until the formation comes to an end. Upon a generally
level surface, therefore, any regular progressive variation in the
strike direction is an indication that the folds have a plunging
or pitching character. Many serious mistakes of interpretation
have been made because of a failure to recognize this evidence of
plunging folds. The way in which the strikes are progressively
modified will be made clear by the diagrams of <a href="#f31">Figs. 31</a> and <a href="#f32">32</a>,
the first representing a pitching anticline and the second a pitching
syncline. In both these reciprocal cases the strikes of the
beds undergo the same changes, and the dip directions serve to
distinguish which of the two structures is present in a given case.
There is, however, one further difference in that the hard layers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
of the plunging anticline, where they disappear below the surface
in the axis, will present a domed surface sloping forward like the
back of a whale as it rises above the surface of the sea. Plunging
folds in series will thus appear in the topography as a series of
sharply zigzagging ranges at those localities where the harder
layers intersect the surface. Such features are encountered in
eastern Pennsylvania, where the hard formations of the Appalachian
Mountain system plunge northeastward under the later
formations. The pitch of the larger fold is often disclosed by that
of the minor puckerings superimposed upon it.</p>

surface (after Fairbanks).</p>
</div></div>

<p><b>The meaning of an unconformity.</b>&mdash;The rock beds, which are
deposited one above the other during a transgression of the sea,
are usually parallel and thus represent a continuous process of
deposition. Such beds are said to be <i>conformable</i>. Where, upon
the other hand, two series of deposits which are not parallel to
each other are separated by a break, they are said to form <i>unconformable</i>
series, and the break or surface of junction is an <i>unconformity</i>
(<a href="#f33">Fig. 33</a>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>Here it is evident that the sediments which compose the lower
series of beds have been folded in the zone of flow, though the
upper series has evidently escaped this vicissitude. Furthermore,
the surface which delimits the lower series from the upper is somewhat
irregular and shows a hard layer standing in relief, as it
would if it had opposed greater resistance to the attacks of the
atmosphere upon it.</p>

direction of movement of the land, and the horizontal
arrows the direction of shore migration.</p>
</div></div>

<p>In reality, an unconformity between formations must be interpreted
to mean that the lower series is not only older than the
upper, as shown by the order of superposition, but that the time
of its deposition was separated from that of the upper by a hiatus
in which important changes took place in the lower series. The
stages or episodes in the history of the beds represented in
<a href="#f33">Fig. 33</a> may be read as follows (see <a href="#f34">Fig. 34 <i>a-e</i></a>):&mdash;</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) Deposition
of the lower series
during a transgression
of the sea.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Continued
subsidence and
burial of the lower
series beneath
overlying sediments,
and flexuring
in the zone of
flow.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Elevation of
the combined deposits
to and far
above sea level and
removal by erosion
of vast thicknesses
of the upper sediments.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) A new subsidence
of the truncated lower series and deposition of the upper
series across its eroded surface.</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) A new elevation of the double series to its present position
above sea level.</p>

unconformities.</p>
</div></div>

<p>From this succession of episodes it is seen that a break of this
kind between two series of deposits involves a double oscillation
of subsidence followed by elevation&mdash;a large depression followed
by a large elevation, a smaller subsidence followed by elevation.
The time interval which must have been represented by these repeated
operations is so vast as at first to stagger the mind in contemplating
it. When, as in this instance, the dips of the lower
series of beds differ from those of the upper, we have to do with
an <i>angular unconformity</i>. It may be, however, that the lower
series was not so far depressed as to enter the zone of flow, and
that its beds meet those of the upper series with apparent conformity.
Such an unconformity is often extremely difficult to
recognize, and it is described as a <i>deceptive</i> or <i>erosional unconformity</i>.</p>

<p>With a deceptive unconformity the clew to its real nature is
usually some fact which indicates that the lower series of sediments
had been raised above the
level of the sea before the upper
series was deposited upon it.
This may be apparent either in
the irregularity of the surface on
which the two series are joined,
in some evidence of the action
of waves such as would be furnished
by a basal conglomerate
in the upper series, or some indication
of different resistance of
different rocks of the lower series
to attacks of the atmosphere
upon them (<a href="#f33">Figs. 33</a> and <a href="#f35">35 <i>a-c</i></a>).</p>

<p>In most cases, at least, the
lowest member of the upper
series will be a different type of
rock from the uppermost member
of the lower series, hence the
frequent occurrence of the discordant
cross bedding in sandstone
should not deceive even the novice into the assumption
of an unconformity.</p>

combinations of the series composing two
double sets of master joints, and in <i>a</i>, <i>a</i>, <i>a</i>
additional disorderly fractures.</p>
</div></div>

<p><b>The system of the fractures.</b>&mdash;In referring to experiments made
upon the fracture of solid blocks under compression (<a href="#Page_41">p. 41</a>), it was
shown that two series of parallel fractures develop perpendicular
to each free surface of
the block, and that
these series are each of
them inclined by half
of a right angle to the
direction of compression,
and thus perpendicular
to each other.
The fragments into
which a block with one
free surface would thus
tend to be divided
should be square prisms
perpendicular to the
free surface. It would
be interesting, if it were
practicable, to learn
from experiment how
these prisms would be
further fractured by a
continuation of the compression.
From mechanical
considerations involving the resolution of forces with reference
to the ready-formed fractures, it seems probable that the next
series of fractures to form would bisect the angles of the first double
series or set. Wherever rocks are found exposed in their original<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
attitudes, they are, in
fact, seen to be intersected
by two parallel
series of fractures
which are perpendicular
to the earth’s surface
and to each other
and are described as
<i>joints</i>. In many cases
more than two series of
such fractures are
found, yet even in
these cases two more
perfectly developed
series are prominent
and almost exactly
perpendicular to each
other as well as to the
earth’s surface. This
omnipresent double series or
<i>set</i> of joints is the well-known
set of <i>master joints</i>, and very
often it is found developed
practically alone (<a href="#f36">Fig. 36</a>).
Over large areas, the direction
of the set of master joints
may remain practically constant,
or this set may quite
suddenly give place to a similar
set which is, however,
turned through half a right
angle from the first (<a href="#f37">Fig. 37</a>). Not infrequently two
such sets of master joints
are found together bisecting
each other’s angles within the
same rocks, and to them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
are sometimes added additional though less perfect series of joint
planes.</p>

<p>Studied throughout a considerable district, the various series
which make up these two sets of master joints may be seen locally
developed in different combinations as well as in association with
additional fissure planes which are not easily reduced to any simple
law of arrangement
(<a href="#f38">Fig. 38 <i>a</i>, <i>a</i>, <i>a</i></a>).
Only rarely are regular
joint series observed
which do not
stand perpendicular
to the original attitude
of the rock
beds. In a few localities,
however, rectangular
joint sets
have been discovered
which divide
the rock into prisms
parallel to the
earth’s surface and
with the joint series inclined to it each by half a right angle.
Where the rock beds have been much disturbed, the complex of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
joints may be such as to defy all attempts at orderly arrangement.</p>

</div></div>

<p><b>The space intervals of joints.</b>&mdash;The same kind of subequal spacing
which characterizes the fractures near the surface of the block
in Daubrée’s experiment (<a href="#f19">Fig. 19</a>, <a href="#Page_41">p. 41</a>) is found simulated by the
rock joints (<a href="#f39">Fig. 39</a>). Such unit intervals between fractures may
be grouped together into larger units which are separated by fractures
of unusual perfection. We may think of such larger space
units as having the smaller ones superimposed upon them (<a href="#f40">Fig. 40</a>).</p>


<p><b>The displacements upon joints&mdash;faults.</b>&mdash;In the vast majority
of cases, the joint fractures when carefully examined betray no
evidence of any appreciable movement of the two walls upon each
other. Generally the rock layers are seen to cross the joints without
apparent displacement. Joints are therefore planes of disjunction
only, and not planes of displacement.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div></div>

<p>Within many districts, however, a displacement may be seen
to have occurred upon certain of the joint planes, and these are
then described as <i>faults</i>. Such displacements of necessity imply
a differential movement of sections or blocks of the earth’s crust,
the so-called <i>orographic blocks</i>, which are bounded by the joint
planes and play individual rôles in the movement. A simple case
of such displacements in rocks intersected by a single set of master
joints is represented in the model of plate 4 C. The most prominent
fault represented by this model runs lengthwise through the
middle, and the displacement which is measured upon it not only
varies between wide limits, but is marked by abrupt changes at
the margins of the larger blocks. This vertical displacement upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
the fault is called its <i>throw</i>. Though not illustrated by the model,
horizontal displacements may likewise occur, and these will be
more fully discussed when the subject of earthquakes is considered
in the following chapter. An actual example of blocks displaced
by vertical adjustment is represented in <a href="#f41">Fig. 41</a>, a simple type of
faulting which has taken place in rocks but slightly disturbed from
their original attitude, but intersected by a relatively simple system
of master joints. In those regions where the beds have been
folded and perhaps overthrust before their elevation into the zone
of fracture, and which are further intersected by disorderly fissure
planes, the results are far more complex. In such cases the
planes of individual displacement may not be vertical, though
they are generally steeper than 45°. For their description it is
necessary to make use of additional
technical terms (<a href="#f42">Fig. 42</a>).
The inclination of a sloping fault
plane measured against the vertical
is called the <i>hade</i> of the fault.
The <i>total displacement</i> is measured
along the plane of the fault from a
point upon one limb to the point
from which it was separated in
the other. The additional terms
are made sufficiently clear by the
diagram.</p>

<p><b>Methods of detecting faults.</b>&mdash;The first effect of a fault is usually
to produce a crack at the surface of the earth; and, provided there
is a vertical displacement or throw, an escarpment which rises
upon the upthrown side of the fault. In general it may be said
that escarpments which appear at the earth’s surface as plane
surfaces probably represent planes of fracture, though not necessarily
planes of faulting. In many cases the actual displacements
lie buried under loose rock débris near to and paralleling the escarpment,
and in some cases as a result of the erosional processes
working upon alternately hard and soft layers of rock, the escarpment
may later appear upon the downthrown side or limb of the
fault (<a href="#f43">Fig. 43</a>). As an illustration of a fault escarpment, the
façade of El Capitan and many other rock faces of the Yosemite
valley may be instanced.</p>

</div></div>

<p>When we have further studied the erosional processes at the
earth’s surface, it will be appreciated that faults tend to quickly
bury themselves from sight, whereas
fold structures will long remain
in evidence. Many faults will thus
be overlooked, and too great weight
is likely to be ascribed to the folds
in accounting for the existing attitudes
and positions of the rock
masses. Faults must therefore be
sought out if mistakes of interpretation
are to be avoided.</p>

<p>The most satisfactory evidence of
a fault is the discovery of a rock bed
which may be easily identified, and
which is actually seen displaced on
a plane of fracture which intersects
it (<a href="#f42">Fig. 42</a>, <a href="#Page_59">p. 59</a>). When such an
easily recognizable layer is not to be
found, the plane of displacement
may perhaps be discovered as a narrow zone composed of angular
fragments of the rock cemented together by minerals which form
out of solution in water. Such a fractured rock zone which
follows a plane of faulting is
a <i>fault breccia</i>. If the fault
breccia, or vein rock, is much
stronger than the rock on
either side, it may eventually
stand in relief at the surface
like a dike or wall. At other
times the displacement produces
little fracture of the
walls, but they slide over each
other in such a manner as to
yield either a smoothly corrugated
or an evenly polished
surface which is described as
“slickensides.” It may be,
however, that during the movement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
either one or both of the walls have “dragged”, and so are
curled back in the immediate neighborhood of the fault plane
(<a href="#f44">Fig. 44</a>).</p>

<p>When, as is quite generally the case, the actual plane of displacement
of a fault is not open to inspection, the movement may
be proven by the observation of
abrupt, as contrasted with gradual,
changes in the strikes and dips
of neighboring exposures (<a href="#f45">Fig. 45</a>);
or by noting that some easily recognized
formation has been
sharply offset in its outcrops (<a href="#f46">Fig. 46</a>).</p>

</div></div>

<p>There are in addition many indications
rather than proofs of the
presence of faults, which must be
taken account of in every general
study of the geology of a district.
Thus the outcrops of all neighboring
formations may terminate
abruptly upon a straight line which
intersects all alike. Deep-seated
fissure springs may be aligned in
a striking manner, and so indicate
the course of a prominent fracture,
though not necessarily of a fault.
Much the same may be said of the
dikes of cooled magma which have
been injected along preëxisting fractures.</p>


<p><b>The base of the geological map.</b>&mdash;Modern
topographic maps form an important
part of the library of the serious
student of physiography; they are the
gazetteer of this branch of science.
Every civilized nation has to-day either completed a topographic
atlas of its territory, or it is vigorously prosecuting a survey to
furnish maps which represent the relief with some detail, and publishing
the results in the form of an atlas of quadrangles. Thus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
a relief map will erelong be obtainable of any part of the civilized
world, and may be purchased in separate sections. Nowhere is this
work being taken up with greater vigor than in the United States,
where a vast domain representing every type of topographic peculiarity
is being attacked from many centers. Here and elsewhere
the relief of the land is being expressed by so-called contours or
lines of equal altitude upon the earth’s surface. It is as though
a series of horizontal planes, separated by uniform intervals of 20
or 40 or 100 feet, had been made to intersect the surface, and the
intersection curves, after consecutive numeration, had been dropped
into a single plane for printing.</p>

<p>Where the slopes are steep, the contour lines in the topographic
map will appear crowded together and so produce a deep shade
upon the map; whereas with relatively flat surfaces white patches
will stand out prominently upon the map. More and more the
topographic map is coming into use, and for the student of nature
in particular it is important to acquire facility in interpreting the
relief from the topographic map. To further this end, a special
model has been devised, and its use is described in appendix C.
Usually before any satisfactory geological map can be prepared,
a contoured topographic map of the district to be studied must
be available.</p>


<p><b>The field map and the areal geological map.</b>&mdash;As the atlas of
topographic maps is the physiographic gazetteer, so geological
maps together constitute the reference dictionary of descriptive
geology. Not only are topographic maps of many districts now
generally available, but more and more it has become the policy
of governments to supply geological maps in the same quadrangle
form which is the unit of the topographic map. The geological
map is, however, a complex of so many conventional symbols,
that without some practical experience in the actual preparation
of one, it is exceedingly difficult for the student to comprehend
its significance. A modern geological map is usually a rectangular
sheet printed in color, upon which are many irregular areas of individual
hue joined to each other like the parts of a child’s picture
puzzle.</p>

<p>The colored areas upon the geological map are each supposed
to indicate where a certain rock type or formation lies immediately
below the surface, and this distribution represents the best judgment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
of the geologist who, after a study of the district, has prepared
the map. Unfortunately the conventions in use are such that his
observation and his theory have been hopelessly intermingled
in the finished product. Armed with the geological map, the
student who visits the district finds spread out before him, it may
be, a landscape of hill and valley, of green forest and brown farming
land, which is as different as may be from the colored puzzle which
he holds in his hand. Hidden under the farm vegetation or masked
by the woods are scattered outcroppings of rock which have been
the basis of the geologist’s judgment in preparing the map. Experience
shows that in order to bridge the wide gap between the
geology in the landscape and the patches of color upon the map
something more than mere examination of the colored sheet is
necessary. We shall therefore describe, with the aid of laboratory
models, the various stages necessary to the preparation of a geological
map, and every student should be advised to follow this by
practical study of some small area where rocks are found in outcrop.</p>

<p>Though the published <i>areal geological map</i> represents both fact
and theory, the map maker retains an unpublished <i>field map</i> or
map of observations, upon which the final map has been based.
This field map shows the location of each outcrop that has been
studied, with a record of the kind of rock and of such observations
as strike, dip, and pitch. Our task will therefore be to prepare:
(1) a field map; (2) an areal geological map; and (3) some typical
geological sections.</p>


<p><b>Laboratory models for the study of geological maps.</b>&mdash;In order
to represent in the laboratory the disposition of rock outcrops
in the field, special laboratory tables are prepared with removable
covers and with fixed tops, which are divided into squares numbered
like the township sections of the national domain (<a href="#f47">Fig. 47</a>).
To represent the rock outcrops, blocks are prepared which may
be fixed in any desired position by fitting a pin into a small augur
hole bored through the table. The outcrop blocks for the sedimentary
rock types are so constructed as to show the strike and
dip of the beds. (See <a href="#Page_472">Appendix D</a>.)</p>

<p><b>The method of preparing the map.</b>&mdash;To prepare the map, use
is made of a geological compass with clinometer attachment, a
protractor, and a map base divided into sections like the top of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
the table, and on the scale of one inch to the foot. Each exposure
represented upon the table is “visited” and then located upon the
base map in its proper position and attitude. The result is the
field map (<a href="#f47">Fig. 47</a>), which thus represents the facts only, unless
there have been uncertainties in the correlation of exposures or
in determining the position of the bedding plane.</p>

selected geological sections.</p>
</div></div>

<p>To prepare the areal geological map from the field map, it is
first necessary to fix the <i>boundaries</i> which separate formations at
the surface; and now perhaps for the first time it is realized how
large an element of uncertainty may enter if the exposures were
widely separated. It is clear that no two persons will draw these
lines in the same positions throughout, though certain portions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
of them&mdash;where the facts are more nearly adequate&mdash;may correspond.
In <a href="#f48">Fig. 48</a> is represented the areal geological map constructed
from the field map, with the doubtful area at one side left
blank.</p>

<p>Some conclusions from this map may now be profitably considered.
The complexly folded sandstone formation at the left
of the map appears as the oldest member represented, since its
area has been cut through by the intrusive granite which does not
intrude other formations, and is unconformably overlaid by the
limestone and its basal layer of conglomerate. The limestone in
turn is unconformably overlaid by the merely tilted sandstone
beds at the right of the map. These three sedimentary formations
clearly represent decreasing amounts of close folding, from
which it is clear that each earlier formation has passed through
an episode not shared by that of next younger age. Of the other
intrusive rocks, the dike of porphyry is younger than all the other
formations, with the possible exception of the upper sandstone.
Offsetting of the formations has disclosed the course of a fault,
and from its relations to the dikes we may learn that of these the
porphyry is younger and the basalt older than the date of the
faulting.</p>

<p>The dashed lines upon the map (<i>AB</i> and <i>CD</i>) have been selected
as appropriate lines along which to construct geological sections
(<a href="#f48">Fig. 48</a>, below map), and from these sections the <i>exposed</i> thicknesses
of the different formations may be calculated. In one instance
only, that of the conglomerate, can we be sure that this
exposed thickness measures the entire formation.</p>


<p><b>Fold <i>versus</i> fault topography.</b>&mdash;The more resistant or “stronger”
rock beds, as regards attacks of the atmosphere, in the course
of time come to stand in relief, separated by depressions which
overlie the “weaker” formations. Simple open folds which are
not plunging exercise an influence upon topography by producing
generally long and straight ridges. More complex flexures, since
they generally plunge, make themselves apparent by features
which in the map are represented by curves. Fracture structures,
and especially block displacements, are differentiated from these
curving features by the dominance of straight or nearly rectilinear
lines upon the map. The effect of erosion is to reduce the asperity
of features and to mold them with flowing curves. The fracture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
structures are for this reason much more likely to be overlooked,
and if they are not to elude the observer, they must be
sought out with care. Fold and fracture structures may both be
revealed upon the same map.</p>

<p class="pch">THE INTERRUPTED CHARACTER OF EARTH MOVEMENTS:
EARTHQUAKES AND SEAQUAKES</p>

<p><b>Nature of earthquake shocks.</b>&mdash;Man’s belief in the stability of
Mother Earth&mdash;the <i>terra firma</i>&mdash;is so inbred in his nature that
even a light shock of earthquake brings a rude awakening. The
terror which it inspires is no doubt largely to be explained by this
disillusionment from the most fundamental of his beliefs. Were
he better advised, the long periods of quiet which separate earthquakes,
and not the lighter shocks which follow all grander disturbances,
would occasion him concern.</p>

<p>Earthquakes are the sensible manifestations of changes in level
or of lateral adjustments of portions of the continents, and the
seismic disturbances upon the sea&mdash;seaquakes and seismic sea
waves&mdash;relate to similar changes upon the floor of the ocean.</p>

<p>During the grander or catastrophic earthquakes, the changes
are indeed terrifying, and have usually been accompanied by losses
to life and property, which are only to be compared with those of
great conflagrations or of inundations on thickly populated plains.
The conflagration has all too frequently been an aftermath of
the great historic earthquakes. The earthquake of December 28,
1908, in southern Italy, destroyed almost the entire population of
a great city, and left of its massive buildings only a confused heap
of rubble (<a href="#f49">Fig. 49</a>). Two years later a heavy earthquake resulted
in great damage to cities in Costa Rica (<a href="#f50">Fig. 50</a>), while two years
earlier our own country was first really awakened to the danger
in which it stands from these convulsive earth throes; though, as
we shall see, these dangers can be largely met through proper
methods of construction.</p>

<p>Earthquakes are usually preceded for a brief instant by subterranean
rumblings whose intensity appears to bear no relation
to the shocks which follow. The ground then rocks in wavelike<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
motions, which, if of large amplitude, may induce nausea, prevent
animals from keeping upon their feet, and wreck all structures
not specially adapted to withstand them. Heavy bodies are sometimes
thrown up from the ground (<a href="#f51">Fig. 51</a>), and at other times
similar heavy masses are, apparently because of their inertia, more
deeply imbedded in the earth. Thus gravestones and heavy stone
posts are often sunk more deeply in the ground and are surrounded
by a hollow and perhaps by small
open cracks in the surface (<a href="#f52">Fig. 52</a>).
When bodies are thrown upward, it
would imply that a quick upward
movement of the ground had been
suddenly arrested, while the burial
of heavy bodies in the earth is probably
due to a movement which
begins suddenly and is less abruptly terminated.</p>

<p><b>Seaquakes and seismic sea waves.</b>&mdash;Upon the ocean the quakes
which emanate from the sea floor are felt on shipboard as sudden
joltings which produce the impression that the ship has struck upon
a shoal, though in most instances there is no visible commotion in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
the water. The distribution of these shocks, as indicated either
by the experiences of neighboring ships at the time of a particular
shock, or by the records of vessels which at different times have
sailed over an area of frequent seismic disturbance, appears to be
limited to narrow zones or lines (<a href="#f53">Fig. 53</a>). The same tendency of under-sea
disturbances to be localized upon definite
straight lines has been often illustrated
by the behavior of deep-sea
cables which are laid in proximity to
one another and which have been
known to part simultaneously at points
ranged upon a straight line.</p>

</div></div>

<p>Far grander disturbances upon the
floor of the ocean have been revealed
by the great sea waves&mdash;the so-called
“tidal waves”, properly referred to as <i>tsunamis</i>&mdash;which recur in
those sea districts which adjoin the special earthquake zones upon
the continents (p. 86). The forerunner of such a sea wave approaching
the shore is usually a sudden withdrawal of the water so as to
lay bare a portion of the bottom, but this is well-recognized to be
the premonition of a gigantic oncoming wave which sweeps all before
it and is only halted when it has rolled over all the low-lying country<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
and encountered a mountain wall. Such seismic waves have
been especially common upon the Pacific shore of South America
and upon the Japanese littoral (<a href="#f54">Fig. 54</a>). These waves proceed
from above the great deeps upon the ocean bottom, and clearly
result from the grander earth movements to which these depressions
owe their exceptional depth. The withdrawal of the water
from neighboring shores may be presumed to be connected with
a descent of the floor of the depression and the consequent drawing-in
of the ocean surface above. The later high wave would
thus represent the dispersion of the mountain of water which is
raised by the meeting of the waters from the different sides of the
depression.</p>

<p><b>The grander and the lesser earth movements.</b>&mdash;Upon the
land the grander and so-called catastrophic earthquakes are
usually the accompaniment of important changes in the surface
of the ground that will be discussed in later sections.
Those shocks which do little damage to structures produce no
visible changes in the earth’s surface, except, it may be, to shake
down some water-soaked masses of earth upon the steeper slopes.
Still other movements, and these too slight to be felt even in
the night when the animal world is at rest, may yet be distinguished
by their sounds, the unmistakable rumblings which are
characteristic alike of the heaviest and the lightest of earthquake
shocks.</p>

<p><b>Changes in the earth’s surface during earthquakes&mdash;faults and
fissures.</b>&mdash;Each of the grander among historic earthquakes has
been accompanied by noteworthy changes in the configuration of
the earth’s surface within the district
where the shocks were most intense.
A section of the ground is usually
found to have moved with reference to
another upon the other side of a vertical
plane which is usually to be seen;
we have here to do with the actual
making of a fault or displacement such
as we find the fossil examples of within
the rocks. The displacement, or throw,
upon the fault plane may be either upward or downward or
laterally in one direction or the other, or these movements may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
combined. A movement of adjacent sections of the ground
upward or downward with reference
to each other (<a href="#f55">Fig. 55</a>) has
been often observed, notably
at Midori after the great Japanese
earthquake of 1891, and
in the Chedrang valley of Assam
after the earthquake of 1897
(<a href="#f56">Fig. 56</a>).</p>

</div></div>

<p>A lateral throw, unaccompanied
by appreciable vertical
displacement (<a href="#f57">Fig. 57</a>), is especially
well illustrated by the
fault in California which was
formed during the earthquake
of 1906 (<a href="#f58">Fig. 58</a>). A combination of the two types of displacement
in one (<a href="#f59">Fig. 59</a>) is exemplified
by the Baishiko fault of
Formosa at the place shown in
plate 3 A.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p><b>The measure of displacement.</b>&mdash;To
afford some measure of the displacements
which have been observed upon earthquake
faults, it may be stated that the
maximum vertical throw measured upon
the fault in the Neo valley of Japan (1891)
was 18 feet, in the Chedrang valley of
Assam (1897) 35 feet, and of the Alaskan
coast (1899) 47 feet. Large sections of
land were bodily uplifted in these cases
within the space of a few seconds, or
at most a few minutes, by the amounts given. The largest recorded
lateral displacement measured upon an earthquake fault
is about 21 feet upon the California
rift after the earthquake of 1906;
though an amount only slightly less
than this is indicated in the shifting
of roads and arroyas dating from the
earthquake of 1872 in the Owens valley,
California. Fault lines once established
are planes of special weakness and
become later the seat of repeated
movements of the same kind.</p>

</div></div>

<p>The greater number of earthquake
faults are found in the loose rock cover
which so generally mantles the firmer
rock basement, and it is almost certain
that the throws within the solid rock
are considerably larger than those
which are here measured at the surface, owing to the adjustments
which so readily take place in the looser materials. Those lighter
shocks of earthquake which are accompanied by no visible displacements
at the surface do,
however, in some instances affect
in a measure the flow of water
upon the surface, and thus indicate
that small changes of surface
level have occurred without
breaks sufficiently sharp to be
perceived (<a href="#f60">Fig. 60</a>). Intermediate
between the steep escarpment
and the masked displacement
just described is the so-called
“mole-hill” effect,&mdash;a rounded
and variously cracked slope or
ridge above the position of a
buried fault (<a href="#f61">Fig. 61</a>).</p>

<div class="floatleft">

of a “mole hill” above a buried
earthquake fault (after Kotô).</p>
</div></div>

<p>The escarpments due to earthquake faults in loose materials
at the earth’s surface can obviously retain their steepness for a
few years or decades at the most; for because of their verticality<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
they must gradually disappear in rounded slopes under the action
of the elements. Smaller displacements within a rock which
rapidly disintegrates under
the action of frost and sun
will likewise before long be
effaced. In those exceptional
instances where a
resistant rock type has had
all altered upper layers
planed away until a fresh
and hard surface is exposed,
and has further
been protected from the
frost and sun beneath a
thin layer of soil, its original
surface may be retained
unaltered for many centuries. Upon such a surface the
lightest of sensible shocks, or even the smaller earth movements
which are not perceived at the time, may leave an almost indelible
record. Such records particularly
show that the movements
which they register occur upon
the planes of jointing within the
rock, and that these ready
formed cracks have probably
been the seats of repeated and
cumulative adjustments (<a href="#f62">Fig. 62</a>).</p>

<p><b>Contraction of the earth’s
surface during earthquakes.</b>&mdash;The
wide variations in the
amount of the lateral displacement
upon earthquake faults,
like those opened in California
in 1906, show that at the time of
a heavy earthquake there must be
large local changes in the
density of the surface materials. Literally, thousands of fissures
may appear in the lowlands, many of them no doubt a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
secondary effect of the shaking, but others, like the <i>quebradas</i> of
the southern Andes or the “earthquake cracks” in the Colorado
desert (<a href="#f63">Fig. 63</a>), may have a deeper-seated origin. Many facts
go to show, however, that though local expansion does occur in
some localities, a surface contraction is a far more general consequence
of earth movement. In civilized countries of high industrial
development, where lines of metal of one kind or another run
for long distances beneath or upon the surface of the ground, such
general contraction of the surface may be easily proven. Comparatively
seldom are lines of metal pulled apart in such a way
as to show an expansion of the surface; whereas bucklings and
kinkings of the lines appear in many places to prove that the area
within which they are found has, as a whole, been reduced.</p>

curbing are raised into broken arches, and the tracks of railways
are thrown into local loops and kinks which imply a very considerable
local contraction of the surface (<a href="#f64">Fig. 64</a>). With unvarying
regularity railway or other bridges which cross rivers or ravines,
if the structures are seriously damaged, indicate that the river
banks have drawn nearer together at the time of the disturbance.
In such cases, whenever
the bridge girder has remained
in place upon its
abutments, these have
either been broken or back-tilted
as a whole in such a
manner as to indicate an
approach of the foundations

<p>The simplest explanation
of such an approach of the banks at the sides of the valleys
cut in loose surface material is to be found in a general closing up
of the joint spaces within the underlying rock, and an adjustment
of the mantle upon the floor mainly in the valley sections
(<a href="#f66">Fig. 66</a>).</p>

</div></div>

<p><b>The plan of an earthquake fault.</b>&mdash;In our consideration of earthquake
faults we have thus far given our attention to the displacement
as viewed at a single locality only. Such displacements are,
however, continued for many miles, and sometimes for hundreds
of miles; and when now we examine a map or plan of such a line
of faulting, new facts of large significance make their appearance.
This may be well illustrated by a study of the plan of the Chedrang<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
fault which appeared at the time of the Assam earthquake of
1897 (<a href="#f67">Fig. 67</a>). From this map it will be noticed that the upward
or downward displacement upon the perpendicular plane of the
fault is not uniform, but is subject to large and <i>sudden</i> changes.
Thus in order the measurements in feet
are 32, 0, 18, 35, 0, 8, 25, 12, 8, 2, 0.
The fault formed in 1899 upon the
shores of Russell Fjord in Alaska (<a href="#f68">Fig. 68</a>)
reveals similar sudden changes of
throw, only that here the direction of
the movement is often reversed; or,
otherwise expressed, the upthrow is
suddenly transferred from one side of
the fault to the other. Such abrupt
changes in the direction of the displacement
have been observed upon
many earthquake faults, and a particularly striking one is represented
in <a href="#f69">Fig. 69</a>.</p>

foreground to the cliff beyond and to the
left of the impounded water (after a
photograph by W. D. Johnson).</p>
</div></div>

<p><b>The block movements of the disturbed district.</b>&mdash;The displacements
upon earthquake faults are thus seen to be subdivided into
sections, each of which differs from its neighbors upon either side
and is sharply separated from them, at least in many instances.
These points of abrupt change of displacement are, in many cases
at least, the intersection points with transverse faults (<a href="#f69">Fig. 69</a>).<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
Such points of abrupt change in the degree or in the direction of
the displacement may be, when looked at from above, abrupt
turning points in the direction
of extension of the fault, whose
course upon the map appears as
a zigzag line made up of straight
sections connected by sharp
elbows (<a href="#f70">Fig. 70</a>).</p>

<p><b>The earth blocks adjusted
during the Alaskan earthquake
of 1899.</b>&mdash;For a study of the
adjustments which take place
between neighboring earth blocks
during a great earthquake, the
recent Alaskan disturbance has
offered the advantage
that the most affected
district was upon the
seacoast, where changes
of level could be referred
to the datum of the sea’s
surface. Here a great
island and large sections
of the neighboring shore
underwent movements
both as a whole in large
blocks and in adjustments
of their subordinate
parts among themselves
(<a href="#f72">Fig. 72</a>). Some
sections of the coast were
here elevated by as much
as 47 feet, while neighboring
sections were uplifted
by smaller amounts
(<a href="#f73">Fig. 73</a>), and certain
smaller sections were
even dropped below the
level of the sea.</p>

<p>The amount of such subsidence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<p class="pch">THE INTERRUPTED CHARACTER OF EARTH MOVEMENTS:
EARTHQUAKES AND SEAQUAKES (Concluded)</p>

<p><b>Experimental demonstration of earth movements.</b>&mdash;The study
of the Alaskan earthquake of 1899 showed that during this adjustment
within the earth’s shell some of the local blocks moved upward
and by larger amounts than their neighbors, and that still
others were actually depressed so that the sea flowed over them.
It must be evident that such differential vertical movements of
neighboring blocks at the earth’s surface can only take place
if lateral transfers of material are made beneath it. From under
those strips of coast land which were depressed, material must
have been moved so as to fill the void which would otherwise have
formed beneath the sections that were uplifted. If we take into
consideration much larger fractions upon the surface of our planet,
we are taught by the great seaquakes which are now registered
upon earthquake instruments at distant stations that large <i>downward</i>
movements are to-day in progress beneath the sea much more
than sufficient to compensate all extensions of the earth’s surface
within those districts where the land is rising in mountains. From
under the offshore deeps of the ocean to beneath the growing
mountains upon the shore, a transfer of earth material must be
assumed to take place when disturbances are registered.</p>

<p>Within the time interval that separates the sudden adjustments
of the surface which are manifested in earthquakes, the condition
of strain which brings them about is steadily accumulating, due,
as we generally assume, to earth contraction through loss of its
heat. It seems probable that the resistance to an immediate adjustment
is found in the rigidity of the shell because of the compression
to which it is subjected. To illustrate: a row of blocks
well fitted to each other may be held firmly as a bridge between
the jaws of a vice, because so soon as each block starts to fall a
large resistance from friction upon its surface is called into existence,
a force which increases with the degree of compression.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>It is thus possible upon this assumption crudely to demonstrate
the adjustment of earth blocks by the simple device represented in
<a href="#p4a">plate 4 A</a>. The construction of this experimental tank is so simple
that little explanation is necessary. Wooden blocks of different
heights are supported in water within a tank having a glass front,
and are kept in a strained condition at other than their natural
positions of flotation by the compression of a simple vice at the
top. Held firmly in this position, they may thus represent the
neighboring blocks within the earth’s outer shell which are supported
upon relatively yielding materials beneath, and prevented
from at once adjusting themselves to their natural positions through
the compression to which they are subjected. Held as they now
are, the water near the ends of the tank is forced up beneath the
blocks to higher than its natural level, and thus tends to flow from
both ends toward the center. Such a movement would permit
the end blocks to drop and force the middle ones to rise. The end
blocks are, let us say, the sections of Alaskan coast line which sunk
during the earthquake, as the center blocks are the sections which
rose the full measure of 47 feet. Upon a larger scale the end blocks
may equally well be considered as the floor of the great deeps off
the Alaskan coast, whose sinking at the time of the earthquake
was the cause of the great sea wave. Upon this assumption the
center blocks would represent the Alaskan coast regarded as a
whole, which underwent a general uplift.</p>

<p>Though we may not, in our experiment, vary the tendency to
adjustment by any contractional changes in either the water or
the blocks, we may reduce the compression of the vice, which leads
to the same general result. As the compression of the vice is
slowly relaxed, a point is at last reached at which friction upon
the block surfaces is no longer sufficient to prevent an adjustment
taking place, and this now suddenly occurs with the result shown in
<a href="#p4b">plate 4 B</a>. In the case of the earth blocks, this sudden adjustment
is accompanied by mass movements of the ground separated by
faults, and these movements produce successional vibrations that
are particularly large near the block margins, and other frictional
vibrations of such small measure as to be generally appreciated by
sounds only. The jolt of the adjustments has thrown some blocks
beyond their natural position of rest, and these sink and rise subsequently
in order to readjust themselves with lighter vibrations,
which may be repeated and continued for some time. In the case
of the earth these later adjustments are the so-called <i>aftershocks</i>
which usually continue throughout a considerable period following
every great earthquake. Gradually they fall off in intensity
and frequency until they can no longer be felt, and are thereafter
continued for a time as rumblings only.</p>

<p><b>Derangement of water flow by earth movement.</b>&mdash;The water
which supported the blocks in our experiment has represented
the more mobile portion of the earth’s substance beneath its outer
zone of fracture. The surface water layers in the tank may, however,
be considered in a different
way, since their behavior is remarkably
like that of the water within
and upon the earth’s surface during
an earth adjustment. At the instant
when adjustment takes place in the
tank, water frequently spurts upward
from the cracks between the sinking
end blocks; and if in place of one
of the higher center blocks we insert
one whose top is below the level of
the water in the tank, a “lake” will
be formed above it. When the adjustment
occurs, this lake is immediately
drained by outflow of the water at its bottom along
one of the cracks between the blocks (<a href="#f76">Fig. 76</a>).</p>

     <div class="cf"><p class="ch250"><span class="smcap">Fig. 76.</span>&mdash;Diagrams to illustrate
the draining of lakes during
earthquakes.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Such derangements of water flow as have been illustrated by
the experiment are among the commonest of the phenomena
which accompany earthquakes. Lakes and swamp lands have
during earthquakes been suddenly drained, fountains of water
have been seen to shoot up from the surface and have played for
some minutes or hours before their sudden disappearance in a sucking
down of the water with later readjustment. During the great
earthquake of the lower Mississippi valley in 1811, known as the
New Madrid earthquake, the earlier Lake Eulalie was completely
drained, and upon the now exposed bed there appeared parallel
fissures on which were ranged funnel-like openings down which
the water had been sucked. In other sections of the affected
region the water shot up in sheets along fissures to the tops of high<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
trees. Areas where such spurting up of the water has been observed
have in most cases been shown to correspond to areas of
depression, and such areas have sometimes been left flooded with
water. During the Indian earthquake of 1819 an area of some
200 square miles suddenly sank and was transformed into a lake.</p>

</div></div>

<p><b>Sand or mud cones and craterlets.</b>&mdash;From a very moderate
depth below the surface to that of several miles, all pore spaces
and all larger openings within the rock are completely filled with
water, the “trunk lines” of whose circulation is by way of the
joints or along the bedding planes of the rocks. The principal
reservoirs, so to speak, of this water inclosed within the rock are
the porous sand formations. When, now, during an earthquake a
block of the earth’s shell is suddenly sunk and as suddenly arrested<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
in its downward movement, the effect is to compress the porous
layers and so force the contained water upward along the joints to
the surface, carrying with it large quantities of the sand (<a href="#f77">Fig. 77</a>).</p>

</div></div>

<p>Ejected at the surface this water appears in fountains usually
arranged in line over joints, or even in continuous sheets, and the
sand collecting about
the jets builds up lines
of <i>sand</i> or <i>mud cones</i>
sometimes described as
“mud volcanoes” (<a href="#f78">Fig. 78</a>).
The amount of
sand thus poured out
is sometimes so great
that blankets of quicksand
are spread over
large sections of the
country. Most frequently,
however, the sand is not built above the general level
of the surface, but forms a series of <i>craterlets</i> which are largely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
shaped as the water is sucked down at the time of the readjustment
with which the play of such earthquake fountains is terminated
(<a href="#f79">Fig. 79</a>). Subsequent excavations made about such craterlets
have shown them to have the form of a trumpet, and that in the
sand which so largely fills them there are generally found scales of
mica and such light bodies as would be picked out from the heterogeneous
materials of the sand layers and carried upward in the
rush of water to the surface (<a href="#f80">Fig. 80</a>).</p>


<p><b>The earth’s zones of heavy earthquake.</b>&mdash;Since earthquakes
give notice of a change of level of the ground, the special danger
zones from this source are the growing mountain systems which
are usually found near the borders of the sea. Such lines of mountains
are to-day rising where for long periods in the past were the
basins of deposition of former seas. They thus represent the
zones upon the earth’s surface which are the most unstable&mdash;which
in the recent period have undergone the greatest changes
of level.</p>

</div></div>

<p>By far the most unstable belt upon the earth’s surface is the
rim surrounding the Pacific Ocean, within which margin it has
been estimated that about 54 per cent of the recorded shocks of
earthquake have occurred. Next in importance for seismic instability
is the zone which borders both the Mediterranean Sea
and the Caribbean&mdash;the American Mediterranean&mdash;and is extended
across central Asia through the Himalayas into Malaysia.
Both zones approximate to great circles upon the earth’s surface
and intersect each other at an angle of about 67°. It has been
estimated that about 95 per cent of the recorded continental earthquakes
have emanated from these belts.</p>

fracture indicated in

which may at any time

movement and resultant
shock.</p>
</div></div>

<p><b>The special lines of heavy shock.</b>&mdash;Within any earthquake
district the shocks are not felt with equal severity at all places,
but there are, on the contrary, definite lines which the disturbance
seems to search out for special damage. From their relations to
the relief of the land these lines would appear to be lines of fracture
upon the boundaries of those sections of the crust that play individual
rôles in the block adjustment which takes place. More
or less masked as these lines are beneath the rounded curves of
the landscape, they are given an altogether unenviable prominence
with each succeeding earthquake. At such times we may think
of the earth’s surface as specially sensitized for laying bare its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
hidden structure, as is the sensitized plate under the magical influence
of the X rays.</p>

<p>When, at the time of an earthquake, blocks are adjusted with
reference to their neighbors, the movements of oscillation are
greatest in those marginal portions
of direct contact. Corners of blocks&mdash;the
intersecting points of the important
faults&mdash;should for the same
reason be shaken with a double
violence, and this assumption appears
to be confirmed by observation.
Upon the island
of Ischia, off the
Bay of Naples,
the shocks from
recent earthquakes
have
been strangely
concentrated
near the town of
Casamicciola,
which was last destroyed in 1883. This unfortunate
city lies at the crossing point of
important fractures whose course upon the
island is marked by numerous springs and
<i>suffioni</i> (<a href="#f81">Fig. 81</a>).</p>

<p><b>Seismotectonic lines.</b>&mdash;The lines of important
earth fractures, as will be more clearly
shown in the sequel (<a href="#Page_227">p. 227</a>), are often indicated
with some clearness by straight lines in
the plan of the surface relief (<a href="#f82">Fig. 82</a>). Lines
of this nature are easily made out upon the
map of the West Indies, and if we represent
upon it by circles of different diameters the
combined intensities of the recorded earthquakes
in the various cities, it appears that
the heavily shaken localities are ranged upon
lines stamped out in the relief, with the most severely damaged
places at their intersections (<a href="#f83">Fig. 83</a>). These lines of exceptional<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
instability are known as <i>seismotectonic lines</i>&mdash;earthquake structure
lines.</p>

</div></div>

<p><b>The heavy shocks above loose foundations.</b>&mdash;It is characteristic
of faults that they soon bury themselves from sight under
loose materials, and are thus made difficult of inspection. The
escarpment which is the direct consequence of a vertical displacement
upon a fault tends to migrate from the place of its formation,
rounding the surface as it does so and burying the fault line beneath
its deposits (<a href="#f43">Fig. 43</a>, <a href="#Page_60">p. 60</a>).</p>

<p>This is not, however, the sole reason why loose foundations
should be places of special danger at the time of earth shocks, for
the reason that earthquake waves are sent out in all directions
from the surfaces of displacement through the medium of the underlying
rock. These waves travel
within the firm rock for considerable
distances with only a gradual dissipation
of their energy, but with their
entry into the loose surface deposits
their energy is quickly used up in
local vibrations of large amplitude,
and hence destructive to buildings.</p>

different effects upon the transmission
and the character of
shocks which are produced by
firm rock and by loose materials.</p>
</div></div>

<p>The essential difference between
firm rock and such loose materials as
are found upon a river bottom or in
the “made land” about our cities
may be illustrated by the simple
device which is represented in <a href="#f84">Fig. 84</a>. Two similar metal pans
are suspended from a firm support by bands of steel and “elastic”
braid of similar size and shape, and carry each a small block of
wood standing upon its end. Similar light blows are now administered
directly to the pans with the effect of upsetting that block<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
which is supported by the loose braid because of the large range
or amplitude of movement that is imparted to the pan. The
“elastic” braid, because of these large vibrations of which it is
susceptible, may represent the loose materials when an earthquake
wave passes into them. In the case of the steel support, the
energy of the blow, instead of being dissipated in local swingings
of the pan, is to a large extent transmitted through the elastic
metal to materials beyond. The steel thus resembles in its high
elasticity the firmer rock basement, which receives and transmits
the earthquake shocks, but except when ruptured in a fault is
subject to vibrations of small amplitude only.</p>


<p><b>Construction in earthquake regions.</b>&mdash;Wherever earthquakes
have been felt, they are certain to occur again; and wherever
mountains are growing or changes of level are in progress, there
no record of past earthquakes is required in order to forecast the
future seismic history. Although the future earthquakes may be
predicted, the time of their coming is, fortunately or unfortunately,
still hidden from us. If one’s lot is to be cast in an earthquake
country, the only sane course to pursue is to build with due regard
to future contingencies.</p>

<p>The danger, from destructive fires may to-day be largely met
by methods of construction which levy an additional burden of
cost. Though the danger from seismic disturbances can hardly
be met as fully as that from fire, yet it is true that buildings may
be so constructed as to withstand all save those heaviest shocks
in the immediate vicinity of the lines of large displacement. Here,
also, a considerable additional expense is involved in the method
of construction, in the case of residences particularly.</p>

<p>From what has been said, it is obvious that much of the danger
from earthquakes can be met by a choice of site away from lines
of important fracture and from areas of relatively loose foundation.
The choice of building materials is next of importance. Those
buildings which succumb to earthquakes are in most cases racked
or shaken apart, and thus they become a prey to their own inherent
properties of inertia. Each part of a structure may be regarded
as a weight which is balanced upon a stiff rod and pivoted upon
the ground. When shocks arrive, each part tends to be thrown
into vibration after the manner of an inverted pendulum. In
proportion, therefore, as the weights are large and rest upon long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
supports, the danger of overthrow and of tearing apart is increased.
In general, structures are best constructed of light materials whose
weight is concentrated near the ground. Masonry structures,
and especially high ones, are, therefore, the least suited for resisting
earthquakes, of which the late complete destruction of the city
of Messina is a grewsome reminder. Despite repeated warnings
in the past, the buildings of that stricken city were generally constructed
of heavy rubble, which in addition had been poorly cemented
(<a href="#f49">Fig. 49</a>, <a href="#Page_67">p. 67</a>). Such structures are usually first ruptured
at the edges and corners, since here the vibrations which tend to
tear the building asunder are resisted by no supports and are
reënforced from neighboring walls.</p>

and partitions were not securely fastened to the walls (after R. L. Humphrey).</p>
</div></div>

<p>An advantage of the first importance is evidently secured if the
rods of the pendulum, of which the building is conceived to be composed,
have sufficient elasticity to be considerably distorted without
rupture and to again recover their original position. This is
the supreme advantage of structural steel for all large buildings,
which is coupled, however, with the disadvantage that the
riveted fastenings are apt to be quickly sheered off under the
vibrations. Large and high buildings, when sufficiently elastic,
have fortunately the property of destroying the earth waves
by interference before they have traveled above the lower
stories.</p>

<p>For large structures in which wood cannot be used, strongly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
reënforced concrete is well adapted, for it has in general the same
advantages as steel with somewhat reduced elasticity, but with a
more effective binding together of the parts. This requirement
of thorough bracing and tying together of the several parts of a
building causes it to vibrate, not as many pendulums, but as one
body. If met, it removes largely the danger from racking strains,
and for small structures particularly it is the requirement which
is most easily complied with. For such buildings it is therefore
necessary that the framework should be built in a close network
with every joint firmly braced and with all parts securely tied together.
Especial attention should be given to the fastenings of
floor and partition ends. The house shown in <a href="#f85">Fig. 85</a> could not
have been subjected to heavy shocks, for though the walls are
thrown down, the floors and partitions have been left near their
original positions.</p>

<p>This tendency of the walls, floors, partitions, and roof to act
as individual units in the vibration, is one that must be reckoned
with and be met by specially effective bracing and tying at the
junctions. Otherwise these larger parts of the structure may act
like battering rams to throw over the walls or portions of them
(<a href="#f86">Fig. 86</a>).</p>

<p class="pch">THE RISE OF MOLTEN ROCK TO THE EARTH’S
SURFACE</p>

<p class="psh">VOLCANIC MOUNTAINS OF EXUDATION</p>

<p><b>Prevalent misconceptions about volcanoes.</b>&mdash;The more or less
common impression that a volcano is a “burning mountain”
or a “smoking mountain” has been much fostered by the school
texts in physical geography in use during an earlier period. The
best introduction to a discussion of volcanoes is, therefore, a disillusionment
from this notion. Far from being burning or smoking,
there is normally no combustion whatever in connection with a
volcanic eruption. The unsophisticated tourist who, looking out
from Naples, sees the steam cap which overhangs the Vesuvian
crater tinged with brown, easily receives the impression that the
material of the cloud is smoke. Even more at night, when a bright
glow is reflected to his eye and soon fades away, only to again glow
brightly after a few moments have passed, is it difficult to remove
the impression that one is watching an intermittent combustion
within the crater. The cloud which floats away from the crest of
the mountain is in reality composed of steam with which is admixed
a larger or smaller proportion of fine rock powder which
gives to the cloud its brownish tone. The glow observed at night
is only a reflection from molten lava within the crater, and the
variation of its brightness is explained by the alternating rise and
fall of the lava surface by a process presently to be explained.</p>

<p>Not only is there no combustion in connection with volcanic
eruptions, but so far as the volcano is a mountain it is a product
of its own action. The grandest of volcanic eruptions have produced
no mountains whatever, but only vast plains or plateaus
of consolidated molten rock, and every volcanic mountain at
some time in its history has risen out of a relatively level surface.</p>

<p>When the traditional notions about volcanoes grew up, it was
supposed that the solid earth was merely a “crust” enveloping
still molten material. As has already been pointed out in an earlier<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
chapter, this view is no longer tenable, for we now know that the
condition of matter within the earth’s interior, while perhaps not
directly comparable to any that is known, yet has properties most
resembling known matter in a solid state; it is much more rigid
than the best tool steel. While there must be reservoirs of molten
rock beneath active volcanoes, it is none the less clear that they
are small, local, and temporary. This is shown by the comparative
study of volcanic outlets within any circumscribed district.</p>

<p>It is perhaps not easy to frame a definition of a volcano, but
its essential part, instead of being a mountain, is rather a vent or
channel which opens up connection between a subsurface reservoir
of molten rock and the surface of the earth. An eruption occurs
whenever there is a rise of this material, together with more or less
steam and admixed gases, to the surface. Such molten rock arriving
at the surface is designated <i>lava</i>. The changes in pressure
upon this material during its elevation induce secondary phenomena
as the surface is approached, and these manifestations are
often most awe inspiring. While often locally destructive, the
geological importance of such phenomena is by reason of their
terrifying aspect likely to be greatly exaggerated.</p>


<p><b>Early views concerning volcanic mountains.</b>&mdash;As already pointed
out, a volcano at its birth is not a mountain at all, but only, so to
speak, a shaft or channel of communication between the surface
and a subterranean reservoir of molten rock. By bringing this
melted rock to the surface there is built up a local elevation which
may be designated a mountain, except where the volume of the
material is so large and is spread to such distances as to produce a
plain (see fissure eruptions below).</p>

<p>In the early history of geology it was the view of the great German
geologist von Buch and his friend and colleague von Humboldt,
that a volcanic mountain was produced in much the same
manner as is a blister upon the body. The fluids which push up
the cuticle in the blister were here replaced by fluid rock which
elevated the sedimentary rock layers at the surface into a dome or
mound which was open at the top&mdash;the so-called <i>crater</i>. This
“elevation-crater” theory of volcanoes long held the stage in
geological science, although it ignored the very patent fact that
the layers on the flanks of volcanic cones are not of sedimentary
rock at all, but, on the contrary, of the volcanic materials which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
are brought up to the surface during the eruption. The observational
phase of science was, however, dawning, and the English
geologists Scrope and Lyell
were able to show by study of
volcanic mountains that the
mound about the volcanic vent
was due to the accumulation
of once molten rock which had
been either exuded or ejected.
Making use of data derived
from New Zealand, Scrope
showed that, instead of being
elevated during the formation
of a volcanic mountain, the sedimentary strata of the vicinity
may be depressed near the volcanic vent (<a href="#f87">Fig. 87</a>).</p>

Auckland, New Zealand, showing the

Heaphy and Scrope).</p>
</div></div>

<p><b>The birth of volcanoes.</b>&mdash;To confirm the impression that the
formation of the volcanic mountain is in reality a secondary phenomenon
connected with eruptions, we may cite the observed birth
of a number of volcanoes. On the 20th of September, 1538, a
new volcano, since known as Monte Nuovo (new mountain), rose
on the border of the ancient Lake Lucrinus to the westward of
Naples. This small mountain attained a height of 440 feet, and
is still to be seen on the shore of the bay of Naples. From Mexico
have been recorded the births of several new volcanoes: Jorullo
in 1759, Pochutla in 1870, and in 1881 a new volcano in the Ajusco
Mountains about midway between the Gulf of Mexico and the
Pacific Ocean. The latest of new volcanoes is that raised in Japan
on November 9, 1910, in connection with the eruption of Usu-san.
This “New Mountain” reached an elevation of 690 feet.</p>

<div class="floatleft">

     <div class="cf"><p class="ch250"><span class="smcap">Fig. 88.</span>&mdash;View of the new Camiguin volcano
from the sea. It was formed in 1871 over
a nearly level plain. The town of Catarman
appears at the right near the shore (after an
unpublished photograph by Professor Dean
C. Worcester).</p>
</div></div>

<p>As described by von Humboldt, Jorullo rose in the night of the
28th of September, 1759, from a fissure which opened in a broad
plain at a point 35 miles distant from any then existing volcano.
The most remarkable of new volcanoes rose in 1871 on the island
of Camiguin northward from Mindanao in the Philippine archipelago.
This mountain was visited by the <i>Challenger</i> expedition
in 1875, and was first ascended and studied thirty years later
by a party under the leadership of Professor Dean C. Worcester,
the Secretary of the Interior of the Philippine Islands, to whom
the writer is indebted for this description and the accompanying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
illustration of this largest and most interesting of new-born volcanoes.
As in the case of Jorullo, the eruption began with the
formation of a fissure in a
level plain, some 400 yards
distant from the town of
Catarman (<a href="#f88">Fig. 88</a>). The
eruption continued for four
years, at the end of which
time the height of the summit
was estimated by the
<i>Challenger</i> expedition to be
1900 feet. At the time of
the first ascent in 1905,
the height was determined by aneroid as 1750 feet, with sharp
rock pinnacles projecting some 50 or 75 feet higher.</p>

<p><b>Active and extinct volcanoes.</b>&mdash;The terms “active” and
“extinct” have come into more or less common use to describe
respectively those volcanoes which show signs of eruptive activity,
and those which are not at the time active. The term “dormant”
is applied to volcanoes recently active and supposed to be in a
doubtfully extinct condition. From a well-known volcano in
the vicinity of Naples, volcanoes which no longer erupt lava or
cinder, but show gaseous emanations (<i>fumeroles</i>) are said to be in
the <i>solfatara</i> condition, or to show <i>solfataric</i> activity.</p>

<p>Experience shows that the term “extinct”, while useful, must
always be interpreted to mean apparently extinct. This may be
illustrated by the history of Mount Vesuvius, which before the
Christian era was forested in the crater and showed no signs of
activity; and in fact it is known that for several centuries no eruption
of the volcano had taken place. Following a premonitory
earthquake felt in the year 63, the mountain burst out in grand
explosive eruption in 79 <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> This eruption profoundly altered
the aspect of the mountain and buried the cities of Pompeii, Stabeii,
and Herculaneum from sight. Once more, this time during the
middle ages, for nearly five centuries (1139 to 1631) there was
complete inactivity, if we except a light ash eruption in the year
1500. During this period of rest the crater was again forested,
but the repose was suddenly terminated by one of the grandest
eruptions in the mountain’s history.</p>

</div></div>

<p><b>The earth’s volcano belts.</b>&mdash;The distribution of volcanoes is
not uniform, but, on the contrary, volcanic vents appear in definite
zones or belts, either upon the margins of the continents or included
within the oceanic areas (<a href="#f89">Fig. 89</a>). The most important of these
belts girdles the Pacific Ocean, and is represented either by chains
or by more widely spaced volcanic mountains throughout the
Cordilleran Mountain system of South and Central America and
Mexico, by the volcanoes of the Coast and Cascade ranges of North
America, the festooned volcanic chain of the Aleutian Islands, and
the similar island arcs off the eastern coast of the Eurasian continent.
The belt is further continued through the islands of
Malaysia to New Zealand, and on the Pacific’s southern margin
are found the volcanoes of Victoria Land, King Edward Land,
and West Antarctica.</p>

</div></div>

<p>This volcano girdle is by no means a perfect one, for in addition
to the principal festoons of the western border there are many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
secondary ones, and still other arcs are found well toward the
center of the oceanic area. Another broad belt of volcanoes borders
the Mediterranean Sea, and is extended westward into the
Atlantic Ocean. Narrower belts are found in both the northern
and southern portions of the Atlantic Ocean, on the margins of
the Caribbean Sea, etc. The fact of greatest significance in the
distribution seems to be that bands of active volcanoes are to be
found wherever mountain ranges are paralleled by deeps on the
neighboring ocean floor (<a href="#f90">Fig. 90</a>). As has been already pointed
out in the chapter upon earthquakes, it is just such places as these
which are the seat of earthquakes; these are zones of the earth’s
crust which are undergoing the most rapid changes of level at the
present time. Thus the rise of the land in mountains is proceeding
simultaneously with the sinking of the sea floor to form the neighboring
deeps.</p>

<p><b>Arrangement of volcanic vents along fissures and especially at
their intersections.</b>&mdash;Within those districts in which volcanoes
are widely separated from their neighbors, the law of their arrangement
is difficult to decipher, but the view that volcanic vents are
aligned over fissures is now supported by so much evidence that
illustrations may be supplied from many regions. An exceptionally
perfect line of small cones is found along the Skaptár
cleft in Iceland, upon which stands the large volcano of Laki.
This fissure reopened in 1783, and great volumes of lava were
exuded. Over the cleft there was left a long line of volcanic
cones (<a href="#f91">Fig. 91</a>). There are in Iceland two dominating series of
parallel fissures of the same character which take their directions
respectively northeast-southwest and north-south. Many such
fissures are traceable at the surface as deep and nearly straight
clefts or <i>gjás</i>, usually a few yards in width, but extending for many
miles. The Eldgjá has a length of more than 18 English miles
and a depth varying from 400 to 600 feet. On some of these
fissures no lava has risen to the surface, whereas others have at
numerous points exuded molten rock. Sometimes one end only
of a fissure, the more widely gaping portion, has supplied the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
conduits for the molten lava. This is well illustrated by the
cratered monticules raised by the common ant over the cracks
which separate the blocks of cement
sidewalk, the hillocks being located
where the most favorable channel was
found for the elevation of the materials.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

of volcanic vents in alignment upon fissures with the larger mountains
at fissure intersections (after Verbeek).</p>
</div></div>

<p>Those places upon fissures which become
lava conduits appear to be the
ones where the cleft gapes widest so as
to furnish the widest channel. Wherever
a differential lateral movement of
the walls has occurred, openings will
be found in the neighborhood of each minor variation from a
straight line (<a href="#f92">Fig. 92 <i>a</i></a>). Wherever there are two or more series
of fissures, and this would appear to be the normal condition,
places favorable for lava conduits occur at fissure intersections.
Within such veritable volcano gardens as are to be found in Malaysia,
the law of volcano distribution became apparent so soon as
accurate maps had been prepared. Thus the outline map of a portion
of the island of Java (<a href="#f93">Fig. 93</a>) shows us that while the volcanoes
of the island present at first sight a more or less irregular
band or zone, there are a number of fissures intersecting in a network,
and that the volcanoes are aligned upon the fissures with
the larger cones located at the intersections. So also in Iceland,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
the great eruption of Askja in 1875 occurred at the intersection
of two lines of fissure.</p>

<p>Outside these closely packed volcanic regions, similar though
less marked networks are indicated; as, for example, in and near
the Gulf of Guinea. If now, instead of reducing the scale of our
volcano maps, we increase it, the same law of distribution is no
less clearly brought out. The monticules or small volcanic cones
which form upon the flanks of larger volcanic mountains are likewise
built up over fissures which on numerous occasions have
been observed to open and the cones to form upon them.</p>

<p>Still further reducing now
the area of our studies and
considering for the moment the
“frozen” surface of the boiling
lava within the caldron of
Kilauea, this when observed at
night reveals in great perfection
the sudden formation of
fissures in the crust with the
appearance of miniature volcanoes
rising successively at
more or less regular intervals
along them.</p>

<p>It not infrequently happens that after a volcanic vent has
become established above some conduit in a fissure, the conduit
migrates along the fissure, thus establishing a new cone with more
or less complete destruction of the old one (<a href="#f94">Fig. 94</a>).</p>


<p><b>The so-called fissure eruptions.</b>&mdash;The grandest of all volcanic
eruptions have been those in which the entire length and breadth
of the fissures have been the passageway for the upwelling lava.
Such grander eruptions have been for the most part prehistoric,
and in later geologic history have occurred chiefly in India, in
Abyssinia, in northwestern Europe, and in the northwestern
United States. In western India the singularly horizontal plateaus
of basaltic lava, the Dekkan traps, cover some 200,000
square miles and are more than a mile in depth. The underlying
basement where it appears about the margins of the basalt is
in many places intersected by dikes or fissure fillings of the same
material. No cones or definite vents have been found.</p>

</div></div>

<p>The larger portion of the northwestern British Isles would
appear to have been at one time similarly blanketed by nearly
horizontal beds of basaltic lava, which beds extended northwestward
across the sea through the Orkney and Faroe islands
to Iceland. Remnants of this vast plateau are to-day found in all
the island groups as well as in large areas of northeastern Ireland,
and fissure fillings of the same material occur throughout large
areas of the British Isles. In many cases these dikes represent
once molten rock which may never
have communicated with the surface
at the time of the lava outpouring, yet
they well illustrate what we might expect
to find if the basalt sheets of
Iceland or Ireland were to be removed.</p>

<p>The floods of basaltic lava which in
the northwestern United States have
yielded the barren plateau of the Cascade
Mountains (<a href="#f95">Fig. 95</a>) would appear
to offer another example of fissure eruption,
though cones appear upon the
surface and perhaps indicate the position of lava outlets during the
later phases of the eruptive period. The barrenness and desolation
of these lava plains is suggested by <a href="#f96">Fig. 96</a>.</p>

<p>Though the greater effusions of lava have occurred in prehistoric
times, and the manner of extrusion has necessarily been
largely inferred from the immense volume of the exuded materials
and the existence of basaltic dikes in neighboring regions, yet in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
Iceland we are able to observe the connection between the dikes
and the lava outflows. Professor Thoroddsen has stated that in
the great basaltic plateau of Iceland, lava has welled out quietly
from the whole length of fissures and often on both sides without
giving rise to the formation of cones. At three wider portions of
the great Eld cleft, lava welled out quietly without the formation
of cones, though here in the southern prolongation of the fissure,
where it was narrower, a row of low slag cones appeared. Where
the lava outwellings occurred, an area of 270 square miles was
flooded.</p>

     <div class="caption"><p class="pc400"><span class="smcap">Fig. 97.</span>&mdash;Characteristic profiles of lava volcanoes. 1, basaltic lava mountain;
2, mountain of siliceous lava (after Judd).</p>
</div></div>

<p><b>The composition and the properties of lava.</b>&mdash;In our study of
igneous rocks (Chapter IV) it was learned that they are composed
for the most part of silicate minerals, and that in their
chemical composition they represent various proportions of silica,
alumina, iron, magnesia, lime, potash, and soda. The more
abundant of these constituents is silica, which varies from 35 to
70 per cent of the whole. Whenever the content of silica is relatively
low,&mdash;basic or basaltic lava,&mdash;the cooled rock is dark in
color and relatively heavy. It melts at a relatively low temperature,
and is in consequence relatively fluid at the temperatures
which lavas usually have on reaching the earth’s surface. Furthermore,
from being more fluid, the water which is nearly always
present in large quantity within the lava more readily makes its
escape upon reaching the surface. Eruptions of such lava are
for this reason without the violent aspects which belong to extrusions
of more siliceous (more “acidic”) lavas. For the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
reason, also, basaltic lava flows more freely and can spread much
farther before it has cooled sufficiently to consolidate. This is
equivalent to saying that its surface will assume a flatter angle of
slope, which in the case of basaltic lava seldom exceeds ten degrees
and may be less than one degree (<a href="#f97">Fig. 97</a>).</p>

<div class="floatleft">

     <div class="cf"><p class="pc200"><span class="smcap">Fig. 98.</span>&mdash;A driblet cone
(after J. D. Dana).</p>
</div></div>

<p>Siliceous lavas, on the other hand, are, when consolidated, relatively
light both in color and weight and melt at relatively high
temperatures. They are, therefore, usually but partly fused and
of a viscous consistency when they arrive at the earth’s surface.
Because of this viscosity they offer much resistance to the liberation
of the contained water, which therefore is released only to
the accompaniment of more or less violent explosions. The lava
is blown into the air and usually falls as consolidated fragments
of various degrees of coarseness.</p>

<div class="floatright">

cone in the Owens valley, California (after an
unpublished photograph by W. D. Johnson).</p>
</div></div>

<p>It must not, however, be assumed that the temperature of lava
is always the same when it arrives at the surface, and hence it
may happen that a siliceous lava is exuded
at so high a temperature that it behaves
like a normal basaltic lava. On the other
hand, basaltic lavas may be extruded at
unusually low temperatures, in which case
their behavior may resemble that of the
normal siliceous lavas. If, however, as is
generally the case, the energy of explosion
of a basaltic lava is relatively small, any
ejected portions of the liquid lava travel
to a moderate height only in the air, so that on falling they are
still sufficiently pasty to
adhere to rock surfaces
and thus build up the
remarkably steep cones
and spines known as
“spatter cones” or
“driblet cones” (<a href="#f98">Fig. 98</a>).
When, on the other
hand, the energy of explosion
is great, as is normally
the case with siliceous
lavas, the portions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
of ejected lava have been fully consolidated before their fall to the
surface, so that they build up the same type of accumulation as
would sand falling in the same manner. The structures which
they form are known as tuff, cinder, or ash cones (<a href="#f99">Fig. 99</a>).</p>

<p>Whenever the contained water passes off from siliceous lavas
without violent explosions, the lava may flow from the vent, but
in contrast to basaltic lavas it travels a short distance only before
consolidating. The resulting mountain is in consequence proportionately
high and steep (<a href="#f97">Fig. 97</a>). Eruptions characterized by
violent explosions accompanied by a fall of cinder are described
as <i>explosive</i> eruptions. Those which are relatively quiet, and in
which the chief product is in the form of streams of flowing lava,
are spoken of as <i>convulsive</i> eruptions.</p>


<p><b>The three main types of volcanic mountain.</b>&mdash;If the eruptions
at a volcanic vent are exclusively of the explosive type, the material
of the mountain which results is throughout tuff or cinder,
and the volcano is described as a <i>cinder cone</i>. If, on the other
hand, the vent at every eruption exudes lava, a mountain of solid
rock results which is a <i>lava dome</i>. It is, however, the exception
for a volcano which has a long history to manifest but a single
kind of eruption. At one time exuding lava comparatively
quietly, at another the violence with which the steam is liberated
yields only cinder, and the mountain is a composite of the two
materials and is known as a <i>composite volcanic cone</i>.</p>


<p><b>The lava dome.</b>&mdash;When successive lava flows come from a
crater, the structure which results has the form of a more or less
perfect dome. If the lava be of the basaltic or fluid type, the
slopes are flat, seldom making an angle of as much as ten degrees
with the horizon and flatter toward the summit (<a href="#f101">Fig. 101</a>, <a href="#Page_106">p. 106</a>).
If of siliceous or viscous lava, on the other hand, the slopes are
correspondingly steep and in some cases precipitous. To this
latter class belong some of the <i>Kuppen</i> of Germany, the <i>puys</i> of
central France, and the <i>mamelons</i> of the Island of Bourbon.</p>

volcanoes of Mokuaweoweo (Mauna
Loa) and Kilauea (after the government

</div></div>

<p><b>The basaltic lava domes of Hawaii.</b>&mdash;At the “crossroads of
the Pacific” rises a double line of lava volcanoes which reach
from 20,000 to 30,000 feet above the floor of the ocean, some
of them among the grandest volcanic mountains that are known.
More than half the height and a much larger proportion of the
bulk of the largest of these are hidden beneath the ocean’s surface.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
The two great active vents are Mokuaweoweo (on Mauna Loa)
and Kilauea, distinct volcanoes notwithstanding the fact that their
lava extravasations have been merged in a single mass. The rim
of the crater of Mauna Loa is at an elevation of 13,675 feet above
the sea, whereas that of Kilauea
is less than 4000 feet and appears
to rest upon the flank of
the larger mountain (<a href="#f100">Figs. 100</a>
and <a href="#f101">101</a>). Although one crater
is but 20 miles distant from the
other and nearly 10,000 feet
lower, their eruptions have apparently
been unsympathetic.
Nowhere have still active lava
mountains been subjected to
such frequent observations extending
throughout a long period,
and the dynamics of their
eruptions are fairly well understood.
To put this before the
reader, it will be best to consider
both mountains, for
though they have much in common, the observations from one are
strangely complementary to those of the other. The lower crater
being easily accessible, Kilauea has been often visited, and there
exists a long series of more or less consecutive observations upon
it, which have been assembled and studied by Dana and Hitchcock.
The place of outflow of the Kilauea lavas has not generally
been visible, whereas Mokuaweoweo has slopes rising nearly 14,000
feet above the sea and displays the records of outflow of many
eruptions, some of which were accompanied by the grandest of
volcanic phenomena.</p>

<p><b>Lava movements within the caldron of Kilauea.</b>&mdash;The craters
of these mountains are the largest of active ones, each being in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
excess of seven miles in circumference. In shape they are irregularly
elliptical and consist of a series of steps or terraces descending
to a pit at the bottom, in which are open lakes of boiling lava.
Enough is known of the history of Kilauea to state that the steep
cliffs bounding the terraces are fault walls produced by inbreak
of a frozen lava surface. The cliff below the so-called “black
ledge” was produced by the falling in of the frozen lava surface
at the time of the outflow of 1840, the lava issuing upon the
eastern flank of the mountain and pouring into the sea near
Nanawale. Since that date the floor of the pit below the level
of this ledge has been essentially a movable platform of frozen
lava of unknown and doubtless variable thickness which has risen
and descended like the floor of an elevator car between its guiding
ways (<a href="#f102">Fig. 102</a>). The floor has, however, never been complete,
for one or more open lakes are
always to be seen, that of Halemaumau
located near the southwestern
margin having been much
the most persistent. Within the
open lakes the boiling lava is apparently
white hot at the depth
of but a few inches below the
surface, and in the overturnings of the mass these hotter portions
are brought to the surface and appear as white streaks marking
the redder surface portions. From time to time the surface
freezes over, then cracks open and erupt at favored points along
the fissures, sending up jets and fountains of lava, the material of
which falls in pasty fragments that build up driblet cones. Small
fluid clots are shot out, carrying a threadlike line of lava glass
behind them, the well-known “Pelé’s hair.” Sometimes the open
lakes build up congealed walls, rising above the general level of
the pit, and from their rim the lava spills over in cascades to
spread out upon the frozen floor, thus increasing its thickness from
above (<a href="#f103">Fig. 103</a>). At other times a great dome of lava has been
pushed up from the pit of Halemaumau under a frozen shell, the
molten lava shining red through cracks in its surface and exuding
so as to heal each widely opened fissure as it forms.</p>

<p>At intervals of from a few years to nine or ten years the crater
has been periodically drained, at which times the moving platform<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
of frozen lava has sunk more or less rapidly to levels far
below the black ledge and from 900 to 1700 feet below the crater
rim. Following this descent a slow progressive rise is inaugurated,
which has sometimes gone on at a rate of more than a hundred
feet per year, though it is usually much slower than this. When
the platform has reached a height varying from 700 to 350 feet
below the crater rim, another sudden settlement occurs which
again carries the pit floor downward a distance of from 300 to 700
feet.</p>

</div></div>

<p><b>The draining of the lava caldrons.</b>&mdash;The changes which go on
within the crater of Mokuaweoweo, though less studied than
those of Kilauea, appear to be in some respects different. Here
every eruption seems to be preceded by a more or less rapid influx
of melted lava to the pit of the crater, this phenomenon being
observed from a distance as a brilliant light above the crater&mdash;the
reflection of the glow from overhanging vapor clouds. The
uprising of the lava has often been accompanied by the formation
of high lava fountains upon the surface, and the molten lava
sometimes appears in fissures near the crater rim at levels well
above the lava surface within the pit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>Although in many cases the lava which has thus flooded the
crater has suddenly drained away without again becoming visible,
it is probable that in such cases an outlet has been found to some
submarine exit, since under-ocean discharge effects have been
observed in connection with eruptions of each of the volcanoes.</p>

<div class="floatright">

     <div class="cf"><p class="ch250"><span class="smcap">Fig. 104.</span>&mdash;Map showing the manner of outflow of
lava from Kilauea during the eruption of 1840.
The outflowing lava made its appearance successively
at the points <i>A</i>, <i>B</i>, <i>C</i>, <i>m</i>, <i>n</i>, and finally at a
point below <i>n</i>, from whence it issued in volume and
flowed down to the sea at Nanawale (after J. D.
Dana).</p>
</div></div>

<p>Inasmuch as no earthquakes are felt in connection with such
outflows as have been described, it is probable that the hot lava
fuses a passageway for itself into some open channel underneath
the flanks of the mountain. Such a course is well illustrated by
the outflow of Kilauea
in 1840, when, it will
be remembered, occurred
the great down-plunge
of the crater
that yielded the pit
below the black ledge.
At this time the lava
first made its appearance
upon the flanks
of the mountain at the
bottom of a small pit
or inbreak crater
which opened five
miles southeast of the
main crater of Kilauea
(<a href="#f104">Fig. 104</a>). Within
this new crater the
lava rose, and small ejections soon followed from fissures formed in
its neighborhood. Some time after, the lava sank in the first new
crater, only to reappear successively at other small openings (<a href="#f104">Fig. 104, <i>B</i>, <i>C</i>, <i>m</i>, <i>n</i></a>) and finally to issue in volume at a point eleven
miles from the shore and flow thereafter <i>upon the surface</i> of the
mountain until it had reached the sea. Only the slightest earth
tremors were felt, and as no rumblings were heard, it is evident
that the lava fused its way along a buried channel largely open at
the time (see below, <a href="#Page_112">p. 112</a>).</p>

<p>In a majority of the eruptions of Mokuaweoweo, when the
outflowing lavas have become visible, the molten rock has apparently
fused its way out to the surface of the mountain at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
points from 1000 to 3000 feet below the bottom of the crater,
and this discharge has corresponded in time to the lowering
of the lava surface within the crater. There are, however,
three instances upon record in which the lava issued from definite
rents which were formed upon the mountain flanks at comparatively
low levels. In contrast to the formation of fused outlets,
these ruptures of a portion of the mountain’s flank were always
accompanied by vigorous local earthquakes of short duration. In
one instance (the eruption of 1851) such a rent appeared under
the same conditions but at an elevation of 12,500 feet, or near
the level of the lava in the crater.</p>


<p><b>The outflow of the lava floods.</b>&mdash;In order to properly comprehend
these and many otherwise puzzling phenomena connected
with volcanoes, it is necessary to keep ever in mind the quite
remarkable heat-insulating property of congealed lava. So soon
as a thin crust has formed upon the surface of molten rock, the
heat of the underlying fluid mass is given off with extreme slowness,
so that lava streams no longer connected with their internal
lava reservoirs may remain molten for decades.</p>

fluid lava discharges into the sea (after H. I. Jensen).</p>
</div></div>

<p>We have seen that for Mokuaweoweo and Kilauea, lava either
quietly melts its way to the surface at the time of outflow, or
else produces a rent for its egress to the accompaniment of vigorous
local earthquakes. In either case if the lava issues at a point<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
far below the crater, gigantic lava fountains arise at the point of
outflow, the fluid rock shooting up to heights which range from
250 to 600 or more feet above the surface. A certain proportion
of this fluid lava is sufficiently cooled to consolidate while traveling
in the air, and falling, it builds up a cinder cone which is left
as a location monument for the place of discharge. From this
outlet the molten lava begins its journey down the slope of the
mountain, and quickly freezes over to produce a tunnel, beneath
the roof of which the fluid lava flows with comparatively slow
further loss of heat. Save for occasional steam jets issuing from
its surface, it may give little indication of its presence until it has
reached the sea (<a href="#f105">Fig. 105</a>).</p>

<p>If sufficient in volume and the shore be not too distant, the
stream of lava arrives at the sea, where, discharging from the
mouth of its tunnel, it throws up vast volumes of steam and induces
ebullition of the water over a wide area (<a href="#f106">Fig. 106</a>). Professor
Dana, who visited Hawaii a few months only after the
great outflow of 1840, states that the lava, upon reaching the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
ocean, was shivered like melted glass and thrown up in millions of
particles which darkened the sky and fell like hail over the surrounding
country. The light was so bright that at a distance of
forty miles fine print could be read at midnight.</p>

<p>Protected from any extensive consolidation by its congealed
cover, the lava within a stream may all drain away, leaving behind
an empty lava tunnel, which in the
case of the Hawaiian volcanoes
sometimes has its roof hung with
beautiful lava stalactites and its
floor studded with thin lava spines.
Later lava outflows over the same
or neighboring courses bury such
tunnels beneath others of similar
nature, giving to the mountain flanks an elongated cellular structure
illustrated schematically in <a href="#f107">Fig. 107</a>. These buried channels
may in the future be again utilized for outflows similar in character
to that of Kilauea in 1840.</p>

<p>While the formation of lava stalactites of such perfection and
beauty is peculiar to the Hawaiian lava tunnels, the formation of
the tunnel in connection with lava outflow is the rule wherever a dissipation
at the end has permitted of drainage. A few hours only
after the flow has begun, the frozen surface has usually a thickness
of a few inches, and this cover may be walked over with the lava still
molten below. At first in part supported by the molten lava, the
tunnel roof sometimes caves in so soon as drainage has occurred.</p>

<p>The surface which flowing lava assumes, while subject to considerable
variation, may yet be classified into two rather distinct
types. On the one hand there is the billowy surface in which
ellipsoidal or kidney-shaped masses, each with dimensions of from
one to several feet, lie merged
in one another, not unlike an
irregular collection of sofa
pillows. This type of lava has
become known as the <i>Pahoehoe</i>,
from the Hawaiian occurrence
(<a href="#f109">Fig. 109</a>). A variation from
this type is the “corded” or
“ropy” lava, the surface of
which much resembles rope as
it is coiled along the deck of
a vessel, the coils being here the
lines of scum or scoriæ arranged
in this manner by the currents
at the surface of the stream
(<a href="#f123">Fig. 123</a>, <a href="#Page_124">p. 124</a>). A quite
different type is the block lava
(<i>Aa</i> type) which usually has a
ragged scoriaceous surface and
consists of more or less separate
fragments of cooled lava (<a href="#f131">Fig. 131</a>, <a href="#Page_130">p. 130</a>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>Wherever lava flows into the sea in quantity, it extends the
margin of the shore, often by considerable areas. The outflow of
Kilauea in 1840 extended the shore of Hawaii outward for the
distance of a quarter of a mile, and a more recent illustration of
such extension of land masses is furnished by <a href="#f110">Fig. 110</a>.</p>

<p class="pch">THE RISE OF MOLTEN ROCK TO THE EARTH’S
SURFACE</p>

<p class="psh">VOLCANIC MOUNTAINS OF EJECTED MATERIALS</p>

<p><b>The mechanics of crater explosions.</b>&mdash;If we now turn from
the lava volcano to the active cinder cone, we encounter an entire
change of scene. In place of the quiet flow and convulsive movements
of the molten lava, we here meet with repeated explosions
of greater or less violence. If we are to profitably study the
manner of the explosions, considering the volcanic vent as a great
experimental apparatus, it would be well to select for our purpose
a volcano which is in a not too violent mood. The well-known
cinder cone of Stromboli in the Eolian group of islands north of
Sicily has, with short and unimportant interruptions, remained in
a state of light explosive activity since the beginning of the Christian
era. Rising as it does some three thousand feet directly out
of the Mediterranean, and displaying by day a white steam cap
and an intermittent glow by night, its summit can be seen for a
distance of a hundred miles at sea and it has justly been called
the “Lighthouse of the Mediterranean.” The “flash” interval
of this beacon may vary from one to twenty minutes, and it may
show, furthermore, considerable variation of intensity.</p>

<p>For the reason that the crater of the mountain is located at
one side and at a considerable distance below the actual summit,
the opportunity here afforded of looking into the crater is most
favorable whenever the direction of the wind is such as to push
aside the overhanging steam cloud (<a href="#f111">Fig. 111</a>). Long ago the
Italian vulcanologist Spallanzani undertook to make observations
from above the crater, and many others since his day have profited
by his example.</p>

<p>Within the crater of the volcano there is seen a lava surface
lightly frozen over and traversed by many cracks from which
vapor jets are issuing. Here, as in the Kilauea crater, there are
open pools of boiling lava. From some of these, lava is seen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
welling out to overflow the frozen surface; from others, steam is
ejected in puffs as though from the stack of a locomotive. Within
others lava is seen heaving up and down in violent ebullition, and
at intervals a great bubble of steam is ejected with explosive violence,
carrying up with it a considerable quantity of the still
molten lava, together with its scumlike surface, to fall outside the
crater and rattle down the mountain’s slope into the sea. Following
this explosion the lava surface in the pool is lowered and
the agitation is renewed, to culminate after the further lapse of a
few minutes in a second explosion of the same nature. The rise
of the lava which
precedes the ejection
appears at night as a
brighter reflection or
glow from the overhanging
steam cloud&mdash;the
flash seen by
the mariner from his
vessel.</p>

excentric position of the crater (after a sketch by
Judd).</p>
</div></div>

<p>What is going on
within the crater of
Stromboli we may
perhaps best illustrate
by the boiling
of a stiff porridge
over a hot fire. Any one who has made corn mush over a hot
camp fire is fully aware that in proportion as the mush becomes
thicker by the addition of the meal, it is necessary to stir the
mass with redoubled vigor if anything is to be retained within the
kettle. The thickening of the mush increases its viscosity to such
an extent that the steam which is generated within it is unable to
make its escape unless aided by openings continually made for it
by the stirring spoon. If the stirring motion be stopped for a
moment, the steam expands to form great bubbles which soon
eject the pasty mass from the kettle.</p>

<p>For the crater of Stromboli this process is illustrated by the
series of diagrams in <a href="#f112">Fig. 112</a>. As the lava rises toward the
surface, presumably as a result of convectional currents within
the chimney of the volcano, the contained steam is relieved from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
pressure, so that at some depth below the surface it begins to
separate out in minute vesicles or bubbles, which, expanding as
they rise, acquire a rapidly accelerating velocity. Soon they flow
together with a quite sudden increase of their expansive energy,
and now shooting upward with further accelerated velocity, a
layer of liquid lava with its cover of scum is raised on the surface
of a gigantic bubble and thrown high into the air. Cooled during
their flight, the quickly congealed lava masses become the tuff or
volcanic ash which is the material of the cinder cone.</p>

Stromboli.</p>
</div></div>

<p><b>Grander volcanic eruptions of cinder cones.</b>&mdash;Most cinder and
composite cones, in the intervals between their grander eruptions,
if not entirely quiescent, lapse into a period, of light activity
during which their crater eruptions appear to be in all essential
respects like the habitual explosions within the Strombolian
crater. This phase of activity is, therefore, described as <i>Strombolian</i>.
By contrast, the occasional grander eruptions which have
punctuated the history of all larger volcanoes are described in
the language of Mercalli as <i>Vulcanian</i> eruptions, from the best
studied example.</p>

<p>Just what it is that at intervals brings on the grander Vulcanian
outburst within a volcano is not known with certainty;
but it is important to note that there is an approach to periodicity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
in the grander eruptions. It is generally possible to distinguish
eruptions of at least two orders of intensity greater than the
Strombolian phase; a grander one, the examples of which may
be separated by centuries, and one or more orders of relatively
moderate intensity which recur at intervals perhaps of decades,
their time intervals subdividing the larger periods marked off by
the eruptions of the first order.</p>

</div></div>

<p><b>The eruption of Volcano in 1888.</b>&mdash;In the Eolian Islands to
the north of Sicily was located the mythical forge of Vulcan.
From this locality has come our word “volcano”, and both the
island and the mountain bear no other
name to-day (<a href="#f113">Fig. 113</a>). There is in the
structure of the island the record of a
somewhat complex volcanic history, but
the form of the large central cinder cone
was, according to Scrope, acquired during
the eruption of 1786, at which time the
crater is reported to have vomited ash for
a period of fifteen days. Passing after
this eruption into the solfatara condition,
with the exception of a light eruption in
1873, the volcano remained quiet until
1886. So active had been the fumeroles
within the crater during the latter part of
this period that an extensive plant had
been established there for the collection
especially of boracic acid. In 1886 occurred
a slight eruption, sufficient to clear out the bottom of the crater,
though not seriously to disturb the English planter whose vineyards
and fig orchards were in the valley or <i>atrio</i> near the point <i>d</i>
upon the map (<a href="#f113">Fig. 113</a>), nearly a mile from the crater rim. On
the 3d of August, 1888, came the opening discharge of an eruption,
which, while not of the first order of magnitude, was yet the greatest
in more than a century of the mountain’s history, and may serve us
to illustrate the Vulcanian phase of activity within a cinder cone.
During the day, to the accompaniment of explosions of considerable
violence, projectiles fell outside the crater rim and rolled
down the steep slopes toward the <i>atrio</i>. These explosions were
repeated at intervals of from twenty to thirty minutes, each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
beginning in a great upward rush of steam and ash, accompanied
by a low rumbling sound. During the following night the eruptions
increased in violence, and the anxious planter remained on
watch in his villa a mile from the crater. Falling asleep toward
morning, he was rudely awakened by a rain of projectiles falling
upon his roof. Hastily snatching up his two children he ran
toward the door just as a red hot projectile, some two feet in diameter,
descended through the roof, ceiling, and floor of the drawing
room, setting fire to the building. A second projectile similar to
the first was smashed into fragments at his feet as he was emerging
from the house, burning one of the children. Making his
escape to Vulcanello at the extremity of the island, the remainder
of the night and the following day, until rescue came from Lipari,
were spent just beyond the range
of the falling masses.</p>

</div></div>

<p>When the writer visited the
island some months later, the
eruption was still so vigorous that
the crater could not be reached.
The ruined villa, smashed and
charred, stood with its walls half
buried in ash and lapilli, among
which were partly smashed pumiceous
lava projectiles. The entire <i>atrio</i> about the mountain lay
buried in cinder to the depth of several feet and was strewn with
projectiles which varied in size from a man’s fist to several feet
in diameter (<a href="#f114">Fig. 114</a>). The larger of these exhibited the peculiar
“bread-crust” surface and had generally been smashed by the
force of their fall after the manner of a pumpkin which has been
thrown hard against the ground. One of these projectiles fully
three feet in diameter was found at the distance of a mile and a
half from the crater. Though diminished considerably in intensity,
the rhythmic explosions within the crater still recurred at
intervals varying from four minutes to half an hour, and were
accompanied by a dull roar easily heard at Lipari on a neighboring
island six miles away. Simultaneously, a dark cloud of “smoke”,
the peculiar “cauliflower cloud” or <i>pino</i> mounted for a couple
of miles above the crater (<a href="#f115">Fig. 115</a>), and the rise was succeeded
by a rain of small lava fragments or <i>lapilli</i> outside the crater rim.</p>

<p>There seems to be no good
reason to doubt that Vulcanian
cinder eruptions of this type
differ chiefly in magnitude from
the rhythmic explosion within
the crater of Stromboli, if we
except the elevation of a considerable
quantity of accessory
and older tuff which is
derived from the inner walls
of the crater and carried upward
into the air together
with the pasty cakes of fresh
lava derived from the chimney.
It is this accessory material
which gives to the <i>pino</i> its dark or even black appearance.</p>

<p><b>The eruption of Taal volcano on January 30, 1911.</b>&mdash;The
recent eruption of the cinder
cone known as Taal volcano
is of interest, not only because
so fresh in mind, but because
two neighboring vents erupted
simultaneously with explosions
of nearly equal violence (<a href="#f116">Fig. 116</a>).
This Philippine volcano
lies near the center of a
lake some fifteen miles in
diameter and about fifty miles
south of the city of Manila.
After a period of rest extending
over one hundred and fifty
years, the symptoms of the
coming eruption developed
rapidly, and on the morning
of January 30 grand explosions
of steam and ash occurred
simultaneously in the
neighboring craters, and the
condensed moisture brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
down the ash in an avalanche of scalding mud which buried the
entire island. Almost the entire population of the island, numbering
several hundreds,
was literally buried in the
blistering mud (<a href="#f117">Fig. 117</a>);
and the gases from the explosions
carried to the distant
shores of the lake
added to this number many
hundred victims.</p>

<p>The shocks which accompanied
the explosions raised
a great wave upon the surface
of the lake, which, advancing
upon the shores,
washed away structures for
a distance of nearly a half
mile.</p>

<p><b>The materials and the
structure of cinder cones.</b>&mdash;Obviously
the materials
which compose cinder cones
are the cooled lava fragments
of various degrees of
coarseness which have been ejected from the crater. If larger
than a finger joint, such fragments are referred to as <i>volcanic
projectiles</i>, or, incorrectly, as “volcanic bombs.” Of the larger
masses it is often true that the force of expulsion has not been
applied opposite the center
of mass of the body.
Thus it follows that they
undergo complex whirling
motions during their
flight, and being still
semiliquid, they develop
curious pear-shaped or
less regular forms (<a href="#f118">Fig. 118</a>).
When crystals
have already separated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
out in the lava before its rise in the chimney of the volcano, the
surrounding fluid lava may be blown to finely divided volcanic
dust which floats away upon the wind, thus leaving the crystals
intact to descend as a crystal rain about the crater. Such a
shower occurred in connection with the eruption of Etna in 1669,
and the black augite crystals may to-day be gathered by the
handful from the slopes of the Monti Rossi (<a href="#f125">Fig. 125</a>, <a href="#Page_125">p. 125</a>).</p>

a cinder cone with use of colored sands carried up
in alternation by a current of air (after G. Linck).</p>
</div></div>

<p>The term <i>lapilli</i>, or sometimes <i>rapilli</i>, is applied to the ejected
lava fragments when of the average size of a finger joint. This is
the material which still
partially covers the unexhumed
portions of the
city of Pompeii. Volcanic
<i>sand</i>, <i>ash</i>, and <i>dust</i>
are terms applied in
order to increasingly
fine particles of the
ejected lava. The finest
material, the volcanic
dust, is often carried
for hundreds and sometimes
even for thousands
of miles from the
crater in the high-level
currents of the atmosphere.
Inasmuch as
this material is deposited
far from the
crater and in layers
more or less horizontal,
such material plays a small rôle in the formation of the cinder
cone. The coarser sands and ash, on the other hand, are the
materials from which the cinder cone is largely constructed.</p>

<p>The manner of formation and the structure of cinder cones
may be illustrated by use of a simple laboratory apparatus (<a href="#f119">Fig. 119</a>).
Through an opening in a board, first white and then
colored sand is sent up in a light current of air or gas supplied
from suitable apparatus. The alternating layers of the sand
form in the attitudes shown; that is to say, dipping inward or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
toward the chimney of the volcano at all points within the crater
rim, and outward or away from it at all points outside (<a href="#f119">Fig. 119</a>).
If the experiment is carried so far that at its termination sand
slides down the crater walls into the chimney below, the inward
dipping layers will be truncated, or even removed entirely, as
shown in <a href="#f119">Fig. 119 <i>b</i></a>.</p>

<p><b>The profile lines of cinder cones.</b>&mdash;The shapes of cinder cones
are notably different from those of lava mountains. While the
latter are domes, the mountains constructed of cinder are conical
and have curves of profile that are concave upward instead of
convex (<a href="#f120">Fig. 120</a>). In the earlier stages of its growth the cinder
cone has a crater which in proportion to the height of the mountain
is relatively broad (<a href="#f99">Fig. 99</a>, <a href="#Page_104">p. 104</a>).</p>

<p>Speaking broadly, the diameter of the crater is a measure of
the violence of the explosions within the chimney. A single series
of short and violent explosive
eruptions builds a low and
broad cinder cone. A long-continued
succession of moderately
violent explosions, on the
other hand, builds a high cone
with crater diameter small if
compared with the mountain’s
altitude, and the profile afforded
is a remarkably beautiful sweeping
curve (<a href="#f121">Fig. 121</a>). Toward
the summit of such a cone the
loose materials of which it is composed are at as steep an angle
as they can lie, the so-called angle of repose of the material;
whereas lower down the flatter slopes have been determined by the
distribution of the cinder during its fall from the air. When one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>

</div></div>

<p><b>The composite cone.</b>&mdash;The life
histories of volcanoes are generally
so varied that lava domes and the
pure types of cinder cones are less
common than volcanoes in which
paroxysmal eruptions have alternated
with explosions, and where, therefore,
the structure of the mountain represents
a composite of lava and cinder.
Such composite cones possess a skeleton
of solid rock upon which have been built up alternate sloping
layers of cinder and lava. In most respects such cones stand in
an intermediate position between
lava domes and cinder
cones.</p>

<p>Regarded as a retaining wall
for the lava which mounts in
the chimney, the cinder cone
is obviously the weakest of
all. Should lava rise in a
cinder cone without an explosion
occurring, the cone is
at once broken through upon
one side by the outwelling
of the lava near the base.
Thus arises the characteristic
<i>breached</i> cone of horseshoe
form (<a href="#f122">Fig. 122</a>).</p>

</div></div>

<p>Quite in contrast with the
weak cinder cone is the lava
dome with its rock walls and
relatively flat slopes. Considered
as a retaining wall for
lava it is much the strongest
type of volcanic mountain,
and it is likely that the hydrostatic pressure of the lava within
the crater would seldom suffice to rupture the walls, were it not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
that the molten rock first fuses its way into old stream tunnels
buried under the mountain slopes (see <i>ante</i>, p. 112). Composite
cones have a strength as retaining walls for lava which is intermediate
between that of the
other types. Their Vulcanian
eruptions of the convulsive
type are initiated by the formation
of a rent or fissure upon
the mountain flanks at elevations
well above the base, the
opening of the fissure being
generally accompanied by a
local earthquake of greater or
less violence.</p>

<p>From one or
more such fissures the lava
issues usually with sufficient
violence at the place of outflow to build up over it either an
enlarged type of driblet cone, referred to as a “mouth”, or <i>bocca</i><a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
(<a href="#f123">Fig. 123</a>), or one or more cinder cones which from their position
upon the flanks of the larger volcano are referred to as <i>parasitic
cones</i> (<a href="#f124">Fig. 124</a>). The lava of Vesuvius more frequently yields
<i>bocchi</i> at the place of outflow, whereas the flanks of Etna are
pimpled with great numbers of parasitic cinder cones, each the
monument to some earlier eruption (<a href="#f125">Fig. 125</a>).</p>

<p>It is generally the case that a single
eruption makes but a relatively small
contribution to the bulk of the mountain.

<p><b>The caldera of composite cones.</b>&mdash;Because
of the varied episodes in the
history of composite cones, they lack the
regular lines characteristic of the two
simpler types. The larger number of the
more important composite cones have
been built up within an outer crater of
relatively large diameter, the Somma cone or <i>caldera</i>, which
surrounds them like a gigantic ruff or collar. This caldera is
clearly in most cases at least the relic of an earlier explosive
crater, after which successive eruptions of lesser violence have
built a more sharply conical structure. This can only be interpreted
to mean that most larger and long-active volcanoes have
been born in the grandest throes of their life history, and that a
larger or smaller lateral migration of the vent has been responsible
for the partial destruction of the explosion crater. Upon Vesuvius<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
we find the crescent-like rim of Monte Somma; on Etna it
is the Val del Bove, etc. It is this caldera of composite cones
which gave rise to the theory of the “elevation crater” of von
Buch (see <i>ante</i>, <a href="#Page_95">p. 95</a>, and <a href="#f127">Fig. 127</a>).</p>

<p><b>The eruption of Vesuvius in 1906.</b>&mdash;The volcano Vesuvius
rises on the shores of the beautiful bay of Naples only about ten
miles distant from the city of Naples. The mountain consists of
the remnant of an earlier broad-mouthed explosion crater, the
Monte Somma, and an inner, more conical elevation, the Monte
Vesuvio. Before the eruption of 1906 this central cone was sharply
conical and rose to
a height of about
4300 feet above
the surface of the
bay, or above the
highest point of the
ancient caldera.
The base of this
inner cone is at an
elevation of something
less than half
that of the entire
mass, and is separated
from the encircling
ring wall of the old crater by the <i>atrio</i>, to which corresponds
in height a perceptible shelf or <i>piano</i> upon the slope toward
the bay of Naples (<a href="#f128">Fig. 128</a>).</p>

</div></div>

<p>An active composite cone like that of Vesuvius is for the greater
part of the time in the Strombolian condition; that is to say, light
crater explosions continue with varying intensity and interval,
except when the mountain has been excited to the periodic Vulcanian
outbreaks with which its history has been punctuated.
The Strombolian explosions have sufficient violence to eject small
fragments of hot lava, which, falling about the crater, slowly built
up a rather sharp cone. The period of Strombolian activity has,
therefore, been called the <i>cone-producing period</i>. Just before each
new outbreak of the Vulcanian type, the altitude of the mountain
has, therefore, reached a maximum, and since the larger explosive
eruptions remove portions of this cone at the same time that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
they increase the dimensions of the crater, the Vulcanian stage in
contrast to the other has been called the <i>crater-producing period</i>.
In this period, then, the material ejected during the explosions does
not consist solely of fresh lava cakes, but in part of the older débris
derived from the crater walls, whence it is avalanched upon the
chimney after each larger explosion. The overhanging
cloud, which during the Strombolian
period has consisted largely of steam and is
noticeably white, now assumes a darker tone,
the “smoke” which characterizes the Vulcanian
eruption.</p>

Hamilton).</p>
</div></div>

<p>On several historical occasions the cone of
Vesuvius has been lowered by several hundred
feet, the greatest of relatively recent truncations
having occurred in 1822 and in 1906. Between
Vulcanian eruptions the Strombolian activity is
by no means uniform, and so the upward growth
of the cone is subject to lesser interruptions and
truncations (<a href="#f129">Fig. 129</a>).</p>

<p>The Vesuvian eruption of 1906 has been
selected as a type of the larger Vulcanian eruption
of composite cones, because it combined the
explosive and paroxysmal elements, and because
it has been observed and studied with greater
thoroughness than any other. The latest previous
eruption of the Vulcanian order had
occurred in 1872. Some two years later the
period of active cone building began and proceeded
with such rapidity that by 1880 the new
cone began to appear above the rim of the crater
of 1872. From this time on occasional light
eruptions interrupted the upbuilding process,
and as the repairs were not in all cases completed
before a new interruption, a nest of cones, each smaller
than the last, arose in series like the outdrawn sections of an old-time
spyglass. At one time no less than five concentric craters
were to be seen.</p>

<p>For a brief period in the fall of 1904 Vesuvius had been in almost
absolute repose, but soon thereafter the Strombolian crater explosions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
were resumed. On May 25, 1905, a small stream of lava
began to issue from a fissure high up upon the central cone, and
from this time on the lava continued to flow down to the valley or
<i>atrio</i>, separating the inner cone from the caldera remnant of Monte
Somma. Seen in the night, this stream of lava appeared from
Naples like a red hot wire laid against the mountain’s side (<a href="#f130">Fig. 130</a>).
With gradual augmentation of Strombolian explosions
and increase in volume of the flowing lava stream, the same condition
continued until the first days of April in 1906. The flowing
lava had then overrun the tracks of the mountain railway and
accumulated in considerable quantity within the <i>atrio</i> (<a href="#f131">Fig. 131</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div></div>

<p>On the morning of April 4, a preliminary stage of the eruption
was inaugurated by the opening of a new radial fissure about 500<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
feet below the summit of the cone (<a href="#f132">Fig. 132 <i>a</i></a>), and by early afternoon
the cone-destroying stage began with the rise of a dark “cauliflower
cloud” or <i>pino</i> to replace the lighter colored steam cloud.
The cone was beginning to fall into the crater, and old lava débris
was mingled in the ejections with the lava clots blown from the
still fluid material within the chimney. From now on short and
snappy lightning flashes played about the black cloud, giving out
a sharp staccato “tack-a-tack.” The volume and density of the
cloud and the intensity of the crater explosions continued to increase
until the culmination on April 7. On April 5 at midnight a
new lava mouth appeared upon the same fissure which had opened
near the summit, but now some 300 feet lower (<a href="#f132">Fig. 132 <i>b</i></a>). The
lava now welled out in larger volume corresponding to its greater
head, and the stream which for ten months had been flowing from
the highest outlet upon the cone now ceased to flow. The next
morning, April 6, at about 8 o’clock, lava broke out at several
points some distance east of the opening <i>b</i>, and evidently upon
another fissure transverse to the first (<a href="#f132">Fig. 132 <i>c</i></a>). The lava surface
within the chimney must still have remained near its old
level,&mdash;effective draining had not yet begun,&mdash;since early upon
the following morning a small outflow began nearly at the top of
the cone upon the opposite side and at least a thousand feet higher.</p>

</div></div>

<p>The culmination of the eruption came in the evening of April 7,
when, to the accompaniment of light earthquakes felt as far as
Naples, lava issued for the first time in great volume from a mouth
more than halfway
down the mountain side
(<a href="#f132">Fig. 132 <i>f</i></a>), and thus
began the drainage of
the chimney. At about
the same time with loud
detonations a huge
black cloud rose above
the crater in connection
with heavy explosions,
and a rain of cinder was
general in the region
about the mountain but
especially within the
northeast quadrant.
Those who were so fortunate
as to be in Pompeii
had a clear view of
the mountain’s summit
where red hot masses of
lava were thrown far
into the air. The direction
of these projections
was reported to have
been not directly upward,
but inclined
toward the northeast
quadrant of the mountain;
but since with a
northeast surface wind
the heaviest deposit of
ash and dust should
have been upon the southwestern quadrant of the mountain, it
is evident that the material was carried upward until it reached
the contrary upper currents of the atmosphere, to be by them distributed.</p>

<p>When the heavy curtain of ash, which now for a number of
succeeding days overhung all the circum-Vesuvian country, began
to lift (<a href="#f133">Fig. 133</a>), it was seen that the summit of the cone had been
truncated an average of some 500 feet (<a href="#f134">Fig. 134</a>). All the slopes
and much of the surrounding country had the aspect of being
buried beneath a cocoa-colored
snow of a depth
to the northeastward of
several feet, where it had
drifted into all the hollow
ways so as almost to
efface them (<a href="#f135">Fig. 135</a>).
More than thrice as
heavy as water, the weak
roof timbers of the houses
at the base of the mountain
gave way beneath
the added load upon
them, thus making many
victims. Inasmuch, however,
as the ash-fall partakes
of the same general characters as in eruptions from cinder
cones, we may here give our attention especially to the streams of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>

<p><b>The sequence of events within the chimney.</b>&mdash;The thorough
study of this Vesuvian eruption has placed us in a position to infer
with some confidence in our conclusions the sequence of events
within the chimney and
crater of the volcano, both
before and during the eruption.
Anticipating some
conclusions derived from the
observed dissection of volcanoes,
which will be discussed
below, it may be
stated that what might be
termed the core of the composite
cone&mdash;the chimney&mdash;is
a more or less cylindrical
plug of cooled lava
which during the active
period of the vent has an
interior bore of probably variable caliber. This plug in its
lower section appears in solid black in all the diagrams of <a href="#f141">Fig. 141</a>.
During the cone-building period (<a href="#f141">Fig. 141 <i>a</i> and <i>b</i></a>) the plug
is obviously built upward along with the cone, for lava often flows
out at a level a few hundred feet only below the crater rim. By<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
what process this chimney
building goes on is not well
understood, though some light
is thrown upon it by the post-eruption
stage of Mont Pelé in
1902-1903 (see below).</p>

<div class="floatleft">
     <img src="images/ill-180.jpg" width="200" height="475" id="f141"

     <div class="cf"><p class="ch200"><span class="smcap">Fig. 141.</span>&mdash;Three diagrams to illustrate
the sequence of events within the crater
of a composite cone during the cone-building
and crater-producing periods.
<i>a</i> and <i>b</i>, two successive stages of the
cone building or Strombolian period;
<i>c</i>, enlargement of the crater, truncation
of the cone, and destruction of the upper
chimney during the relatively brief
crater-producing or Vulcanian period.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Both the older and newer
sections of this plug or chimney
are furnished some support
against the outward pressure
of the contained lava by the
surrounding wall of tuff; and
they are, therefore, in a condition
not unlike that of the
inner barrel of a great gun over
which sleeves of metal have
been shrunk so as to give support
against bursting pressures.
On the other hand, when not
sustaining the hydrostatic pressure
of the liquid lava within,
the chimney would tend to be
crushed in by the pressure
of the surrounding tuff. Its
strength to withstand bursting
pressures is dependent not
alone upon the thickness of its
rock walls, but also upon its
internal diameter or caliber.
A steam cylinder of given
thickness of wall, as is well
known, can resist bursting
pressures in proportion as its
internal diameter is small. So
in the volcanic chimney, any
tendency to remelt from within
the chimney walls must weaken
them in a twofold ratio.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>We are yet without accurate
temperature observations upon the lava in volcanic chimneys,
but it seems almost certain that these temperatures rise as the
Vulcanian stage is approaching, and such elevation of temperature
must be followed by a greater or less re-fusion of the chimney
walls. The sequence of events during the late Vesuvian eruption
is, then, naturally explained by progressive re-fusion and consequent
weakening of the chimney walls, thus permitting a radial
fissure to open near the top and gradually extend downwards.
Thus at first small and high outlets were opened insufficient to
drain the chimney, but later, on April 7, after this fissure had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
been much extended and a new and larger one had opened at a
lower level, the draining began and the surface of lava commenced
rapidly to sink.</p>

<p>When the rapid sinking of the lava surface occurred, the lower
lava layers were almost immediately relieved of pressure, thus
causing a sudden expansion of the contained steam and resulting
in grand crater explosions. The partially refused and fissured
upper chimney, now unable to withstand the inward pressure of
the surrounding tuff walls, since outward pressures no longer
existed, crushed in and contributed its materials and those of
the surrounding tuff to the fragments of fresh lava rising in
volume in the grand explosions (<a href="#f141">Fig. 141 <i>c</i></a>). In outline, then,
these seem to be the conditions which are indicated by the
sequence of observed events in connection with the late Vesuvian
outbreak.</p>

<p><b>The spine of Pelé.</b>&mdash;The disastrous eruption of Mont Pelé
upon Martinique in the year 1902 is of importance in connection
with the interesting problem of the upward growth of volcanic
chimneys during the cone-building period of a volcano. After
the conclusion of this great Vulcanian eruption, a spine of lava<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
grew upward from the chimney of the main crater until it had
reached an elevation of more then a thousand feet above its base,
a figure of the same order of magnitude as the probable height of
the upper section of the Vesuvian chimney previous to the eruption
of 1906. The Pelé spine (<a href="#f142">Fig. 142</a>) did not grow at a uniform
rate, but was subject to smaller or larger truncations, but for a
period of 18 days the upward growth was at the rate of about 41
feet per day. Later, the mass split upon a vertical plane revealing
a concave inner surface, and was somewhat rapidly reduced in
altitude to 600 feet (<a href="#f143">Fig. 143</a>), only to rise again to its full height
of about 1000 feet some three months later.</p>

<p>While apparently unique as an observed phenomenon, and not
free from uncertainty as to its interpretation, the growth of this
obelisk has at least shown us that a mass of rock can push its way
up above the chimney of an active volcano even when there are no
walls of tuff about it to sustain its outward pressures.</p>

     <div class="cf"><p class="ch250"><span class="smcap">Fig. 144.</span>&mdash;Corrugated surface of the Vesuvian cone
after the mud flows which followed the eruption in 1906
(after Johnston-Lavis).</p>
</div></div>

<p><b>The aftermath of mud flows.</b>&mdash;When the late Vulcanian explosions
of Vesuvius had come to an end, all slopes of the mountain,
but especially
the higher ones,
were buried in
thick deposits of
the cocoa-colored
ash, included in
which were larger
and smaller projectiles.
As this
material is extremely
porous, it
greedily sucks up
the water which falls during the first succeeding rains. When
nearly saturated, it begins to descend the slopes of the mountain
and soon develops a velocity quite in contrast with that of the
slow-moving lava. The upper slopes are thus denuded, while
the fields and even the houses about the base are invaded by these
torrents of mud (<i>lava d’acqua</i>). Inasmuch as these mud flows are
the inevitable aftermath of all grander explosive eruptions, the
Italian government has of late spent large sums of money in the
construction of dikes intended to arrest their progress in the future.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
It was streams of this sort that buried the city of Herculaneum
after the explosive eruption of 79 <span class="smcap">A.D.</span></p>

<p>After the mud flows have occurred, the Vesuvian cone, like all
similar volcanic cones under the same conditions, is found with
deep radial corrugations (<a href="#f144">Fig. 144</a>), such as were long ago described
as “barrancoes” and supposed to support the “elevation
crater” theory of volcano formation.</p>


<p><b>The dissection of volcanoes.</b>&mdash;To the uninitiated it might appear
a hopeless undertaking to attempt to learn by observation
the internal structure of a volcano, and especially of a complex
volcano of the composite type. The earliest successful attempt
appears to have been made by Count Caspar von Sternberg in
order to prove the correctness
of the theory
of his friend, the poet
Goethe. Goethe had
claimed that a little
hill in the vicinity of
Eger, on the borders
of Bohemia, was an extinct
volcano, though
the foremost geologist
of the time the famous
Werner, had promulgated
the doctrine
that this hill, in common with others of similar aspect, originated
in the combustion of a bed of coal. The elevation in question,
which is known as the Kammerbühl, consists mainly of cinder,
and Goethe had maintained that if a tunnel were to be driven
horizontally into the mountain from one of its slopes, a core or
plug of lava would be encountered beneath the summit. The
excavations, which were completed in 1837, fully verified the
poet’s view, for a lava plug was found to occupy the center of
the mass and to connect with a small lava stream upon the side
of the hill (<a href="#f145">Fig. 145</a>).</p>

</div></div>

<p>It is not, however, to such expensive projects that reference
is here made, but rather to processes which are continually going
on in nature, and on a far grander scale. The most important
dissecting agent for our purpose is running water, which is continually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
paring down the earth’s surface and disclosing its buried
structures. How much more convincing than any results of
artificial excavation, as evidence of the internal structure of a
volcano, is the monument represented in <a href="#f146">Fig. 146</a>, since here the
lava plug stands in relief like a
gigantic thumb still surrounded by
a remnant of cinder deposits. Such
exposed chimneys of former volcanoes
are found in many regions, and have
become known as volcanic <i>necks</i>,
<i>pipes</i>, or <i>plugs</i>.</p>

<p>Not infrequently the beds of tuff
composing the flanks of the volcano,
upon dissection by the same process,
bring to light walls of cooled lava
standing in relief (<a href="#f147">Fig. 147</a>)&mdash;the
filling of the fissure which gave outlet
to the flanks of the mountain at the
time of the eruption. Study of exposed
dikes formed in connection
with recent eruptions of Vesuvius
has shown that in many instances they are still hollow, the lava
having drained from them before complete consolidation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>Another agent which is effective in uncovering the buried structures
of volcanoes is the action of waves on shores. Always a
relatively vigorous erosive agency, the softer structures of volcanic
cones are removed with especial facility by this agent. On
the shores of the island of Volcano, the little
cone of Vulcanello has been nearly half
carried away by the waves, so as to reveal
with especial perfection the structure of the
cinder beds as well as the internal rock
skeleton of the mass. Here the characteristic
dips of lava streams, intercalated as
they now are between tuff deposits and the
lava which consolidated in fissures, are both
revealed.</p>

<p>In mid-Atlantic a quite perfect crater, the
St. Paul’s Rocks, has been cut nearly in
half so as to produce a natural harbor
(<a href="#f148">Fig. 148</a>).</p>

<p>In still other instances we may thank the
volcano itself for opening up the interior of
the mountain for our inspection. The eruption in 1888 of the
Japanese volcano of Bandai-san, by removing a considerable part
of the ancient cone, has afforded us a section completely through
the mountain. The summit and one side of the small Bandai was
carried completely away, and there was substituted a yawning
crater eccentric to the former mountain and having its highest
wall no less than 1500
feet in height (<a href="#f149">Fig. 149</a>).
In two hours from the
first warning of the explosion
the catastrophe
was complete and the
eruption over.</p>

<p>The eruption of Krakatoa
in 1883, probably
the grandest observed volcanic explosion in historic times, left
a volcanic cone divided almost in half and open to inspection
(<a href="#f150">Fig. 150</a>). Rakata, Danan, and Perbuatan had before constituted
a line of cones built up round individual craters subsequent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
to the partial destruction of an earlier caldera, portions
of which were still existent in the islands Verlaten and Lang.
By the eruption of 1883 all the exposed parts and considerable
submerged portions of the two smaller cones were entirely destroyed,
and the larger one, known as Rakata, was divided just
outside the plug so as to leave a precipitous wall rising directly
from the sea and
showing lava streams
in alternation with
somewhat thicker
tuff layers, the whole
knit together by numerous
lava dikes.</p>

</div></div>

<p>In order to carry
our dissecting process
down to levels
below the base of the volcanic mountain, it is usually necessary to
inspect the results of erosion by running water. Here the plug or
chimney, instead of being surrounded by tuff, is inclosed by the
country rock of the region, which is commonly a sedimentary
formation. Such exposed lower sections of volcanic chimneys are
numerous along the northwestern shores of the British Isles.
Where aligned upon
a dislocation or noteworthy
fissure in the
rocks, the group of
plugs has been referred
to as a scar or
<i>cicatrice</i> (<a href="#f151">Fig. 151</a>).
Associated with the
plugs of the cicatrice
are not infrequently
dikes, or, it may be, sheets of lava extended between layers of
sediment and known as <i>sills</i>.</p>

</div></div>

<p>If we are able to continue the dissection process to still greater
depths, we encounter at last igneous rock having a texture known
as granitic and indicating that the process of consolidation was
not only exceedingly slow but also uninterrupted. This rock
is found in masses of larger dimensions, and though generally of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
more or less irregular form, no one dimension is of a different order
of magnitude from the others. Such masses are commonly described
as <i>bosses</i>, or, if especially large, as <i>batholites</i> (<a href="#f152">Fig. 152</a>).
Wherever the rock beds appear as though they had been forced
up by the upward pressure of the igneous mass, the latter takes
the form of a mushroom and has been described as a <i>laccolite</i>
(<a href="#f479">Figs. 479-481</a>, <a href="#Page_441">pp. 441-442</a>). Evidence seems, however, to accumulate
that in the greater number of cases the molten rock has fused
its way upward, in part assimilating and in part inclosing the rock
which it encountered. This process
of upward fusion has been
likened to the progress of a red
hot iron burning its way through
a board.</p>


<p><b>The formation of lava reservoirs.</b>&mdash;The
discarding of the
earlier notion that the earth has
a liquid interior makes it proper
in discussing the subject of volcanoes
to at least touch upon
the origin of the molten rock
material. As already pointed
out, such reservoirs as exist
must be local and temporary,
or it would be difficult to see
how the existing condition of
earth rigidity could be maintained.
From the rate at which rock temperatures rise, at
increasing depths below the surface, it is clear that all rocks would
be melted at very moderate depths only, if they were not kept in a
solid state by the prodigious loads which they sustain. Any relief
from this load should at once result in fusion of the rock.</p>

     <div class="cf"><p class="ch250"><span class="smcap">Fig. 152.</span>&mdash;Diagram to illustrate a probable
cause of formation of lava reservoirs,
and to show the connection
between such reservoirs and the volcanoes
at the surface.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Now the restriction of active volcanoes to those zones of the
earth’s surface within which mountains are rising, and where
in consequence earthquakes are felt, has furnished us at least a
clew to the origin of the lava. Regarded as a structure capable
of sustaining a load, the competency of an arch is something quite
remarkable, so that the arching up of strong rock formations into
anticlines within the upper layers of the zone of flow, or of combined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
fracture and flow, would be sufficient to remove the load
from relatively weak underlying beds, which in consequence would
be fused and form local reservoirs of lava (<a href="#f152">Figs. 152</a> and <a href="#f153">153</a>).</p>

<p>It has been further quite generally observed that lines of volcanoes,
in so far as they betray any relation in position to neighboring
mountain ranges, tend to appear upon the rear or flatter
limb of unsymmetrical arches, or where local tension would favor
the opening of channels toward the surface. Moreover, wherever
recent block movements of surface portions of the earth’s shell
have been disclosed in the neighborhood of volcanoes, the latter
appear to be connected with downthrown blocks, as though the lava
had, so to speak, been squeezed out from
beneath the depressed block or blocks.</p>

</div></div>

<p>We must not, however, forget that the
igneous rocks are greatly restricted in the
range of their chemical composition. No
igneous rock type is known which could
be formed by the fusion of any of the
carbonate rocks such as limestone or
dolomite, or of the more siliceous rocks,
such as sandstone or quartzite. There
remains only the argillaceous class of
sediments, the shales and slates, and so
soon as we examine the composition of these rocks we are struck by
the remarkable resemblance to that of the class of igneous rocks.
For purposes of comparison there is given below the composite or
average constitution of igneous rocks in parallel column, with the
average attained by combining the analyses of 56 slates and shales,
the latter recalculated with water excluded:</p>

<p class="p1">This close resemblance is probably of deep significance, for the
reason that shales and slates are structurally the weakest of all
rocks and for the further reason that they rather generally directly
underlie the carbonate rocks, which are by contrast the
strongest (see <i>ante</i>, <a href="#Page_37">p. 37</a>). For these reasons shales and slates are
the only rocks which are likely to be fused by relief from load
through the formation of anticlinal arches within the earth’s zone
of flow. If this view is well founded, lavas and other igneous
rocks are in large part fused argillaceous sediments formed in connection
with the process of folding, or are refused rocks of igneous
origin and similar composition.</p>


<p><b>Character profiles.</b>&mdash;The character profiles of features connected
in their origin with volcanoes are particularly easy to
recognize, and in a few cases in which they might be confused with
others of a different origin, an examination of the materials of
the features should lead to a definitive judgment.</p>

<p>The lava plains which result from massive outflows of basalt
might perhaps strictly be regarded as lack of feature, so great may
be their continuous extent. Wherever definite vents exist, a
broad flat dome is the usual result of the extravasation of a basaltic
lava. The puys of France and many of the Kuppen of Germany,
being formed from less fluid lava, have afforded profiles
with relatively small radius of curvature.</p>

<p>In its youthful stage, the cinder cone usually presents a broad
summit sag and relatively short side slopes, whereas the cone of
later stages is apt to present long sweeping and upwardly concave
curves with both the gradient and the radius of curvature increasing
rapidly toward the summit. In contrast, too, with the earlier
stage, the crest is relatively small. A marked reduction in the
high symmetry of such profiles is noted wherever a breaching by
lava outflow has occurred (<a href="#f154">Fig. 154</a>).</p>

<p>With the composite cone, complexity and corresponding lack
of symmetry is introduced, especially in the partially ruined
caldera, and by the more or less accidental distribution of parasitic
cones, as well as by migrations of the central cone. Peculiarly
similar acuminated profiles result from spatter-cone formation,
from the formation of a superchimney spine, and by the uncovering
of the chimney through denudational processes&mdash;the volcanic
neck.</p>

<p>Another important feature resulting from denudation is the
Mesa or table mountain with its protecting basalt cap above softer
rocks. Its profile most resembles that of table mountains due to
differential erosion of alternately strong and weak horizontally
bedded rocks, such as compose the upper portion of the section in
the Grand Cañon of the Colorado. Here, however, in place of a
single unusually strong top layer there are found several strong
layers in alternation with weaker ones so as to produce additional
steps in the profile.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XI</h2>

<p class="pch">THE ATTACK OF THE WEATHER</p>

<p><b>The two contrasted processes of weathering.</b>&mdash;It has already
been pointed out that change and not stability is the order of
nature. Within the earth’s outer shell and upon it rock alteration
goes on continually, and from some portions of its surface the
changed material is as constantly migrating to neighboring or
even far distant regions. Before such transportation can begin
the hard rock must first be broken down and reduced to fragments
which the transporting agencies are competent to move.</p>

<p>To accomplish this breaking down, or <i>degeneration</i>, of the rock
masses, either a wide range in temperature or chemical reaction is
essential. In the atmosphere are found such active chemical
agents as oxygen and carbon dioxide, the so-called carbonic acid
gas; and these agents in the presence of water react chemically
with the minerals of the rocks and form other minerals such as the
hydrates and carbonates, which are lighter in weight and more
soluble. This <i>chemical</i> attack upon the outer shell of the lithosphere
is described as <i>decomposition</i>.</p>

<p>On the other hand the rock may succumb to changes which are
purely mechanical and are due either to the stresses set up by differences
between surface and interior temperatures, or to the prying
action of the frost in the crevices. Such purely mechanical degeneration
of the rocks is in contrast with decomposition and is
described as <i>disintegration</i>. The two processes of decomposition
and disintegration may, however, go on together; and the changes
of volume that are caused by decomposition may result directly
in considerable disintegration, as we are to see.</p>


<p><b>The rôle of the percolating water.</b>&mdash;In order to effect chemical
change or reaction, it is essential that the substances which are
to react must be brought into such intimate contact with each
other as it is seldom possible to attain except by solution. The
chemical reactions which go on between the gaseous atmosphere
and the solid lithosphere are accomplished through solution of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
gases in water. This water, derived from rain or snow, percolates
into the ground or descends along the crevices in the rocks, carrying
with it a certain measure of dissolved air. This air differs
from that of the surrounding atmospheric envelope by containing
relatively large amounts of oxygen and
of the other active element carbon dioxide.
It follows from the important rôle
thus performed by the percolating water
that the process of decomposition will
be relatively important in humid regions
where the atmospheric precipitation
is sufficient for the purpose.</p>

to show the effect of
decomposition and resulting
disintegration upon joint
blocks so as to produce
spheroidal bowlders by
weathering.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Within hot and dry regions there is
a larger measure of rock disintegration,
and distinct chemical changes unlike
those of humid regions take place in the
higher temperatures and with the more
concentrated saline solutions. The discussion
of such changes will be deferred
until desert conditions are treated in
another chapter.</p>


<p><b>Mechanical results of decomposition&mdash;spheroidal
weathering.</b>&mdash;From an
earlier chapter it has been learned that
the rocks of the earth’s outermost shell
are generally intersected by a system of
vertical fissures which at each locality
tend to divide the rock into parallel and
upright rectangular prisms. It is these
joints which offer relatively easy paths
for the descent of the water into the
rocks. In rocks of sedimentary origin
there are found, in addition to the vertical joints, planes of bedding
originally horizontal, and in the intrusive and volcanic rocks
a somewhat similar parting, likewise parallel to the surface of the
ground. The combined effect of the joints and the additional
parting planes is thus to separate the rock mass into more or
less perfect squared blocks (<a href="#f155">Fig. 155</a>, upper figure) which stand
in vertical columns.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>The water which percolates downward upon the joints, finds
its way laterally along the parting planes, and so subjects the entire
surface of each block to simultaneous attack by its reagents.
Though all parts of the surface of each block are alike subject to
attack, it is the angles and the edges which are most vigorously
acted upon. In the narrow crevices the solutions move but sluggishly,
and as they are soon impoverished of their reagents in the
attack upon the rock, fresh solution can reach the middle of the
faces from relatively few directions. The edges are at the same
time being reached from many more directions, and the corners
from a still larger number.</p>

<p>The minerals newly formed by these chemical processes of
hydration and carbonization are notably lighter, and hence more
bulky than the minerals from whose constituents they have been
largely formed. Strains are thus set up which tend to separate
the bulkier new material from the core of unaltered rock below.
As the process continues, distinct channels for the moving waters
are developed favorable to action at the edges and corners of the
blocks. Eventually, the squared block is by this process transformed
into a spheroidal core of still unaltered rock wrapped in
layers of decomposed material, like the outer wrappings of an onion.
These in turn are usually imbedded in more thoroughly disintegrated
material from which
the shell structure has disappeared
(<a href="#f156">Fig. 156</a>).</p>

</div></div>

<p><b>Exfoliation or scaling.</b>&mdash;A
fact of much importance to
geologists, but one far too
often overlooked, is that rocks
are but poor conductors for
heat. It results from this
that in the bright sun of a
summer’s day a thin skin, as
it were, upon the rock surface may be heated to a relatively high
temperature, although the layer immediately below it is practically
unaffected. The consequent expansion of the surface layer
causes stresses that tend to scale it off from the layer below,
which, uncovered in its turn, develops new strains of the same
sort. This process of exfoliation acquires exceptional importance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
in desert regions where the rock surfaces are daily elevated to
excessively high temperatures (see <a href="#Page_197">Chapter XV</a>).</p>

mass, Yosemite valley, California
(after a photograph by Sinclair).</p>
</div></div>

<p><b>Dome structure in granite masses.</b>&mdash;In large granite masses,
such as are to be found in the ranges of the Sierra Nevada of California,
a peculiar dome structure is sometimes found developed
upon a large scale, and has had an important influence upon the
breaking down of the rock and
upon the shaping of the mountain
(<a href="#f157">Fig. 157</a>). Such a structure, made
up as it is of prodigious layers,
can have little in common with
the veneers of weathered minerals
which are the result of exfoliation,
and it is quite likely that
the dome structure is in some
way connected with the relief of
these massive rocks from their
load&mdash;the rock which once rested
upon them, but has been carried away by erosion since the uplift
of the range.</p>

<p><b>The prying work of frost.</b>&mdash;In all countries where winter temperatures
range below the freezing point of water, a most potent
agent of rock disintegration is the frost which pries at every crevice
and cranny of the surface rock. Important in the temperate zones,
in the polar regions it becomes almost the sole effective agent of
rock weathering. There, as elsewhere, its efficiency as a disintegrating
agent is directly dependent upon the nature of the crevices
within the rock, so that the omnipresent joints are able to exercise
a degree of control over the sculpturing of the surface features
which is hardly to be looked for elsewhere (see <a href="#p10a">plate 10 A</a>).</p>

     <div class="caption"><p class="pc250"><span class="smcap">Fig. 158.</span>&mdash;Talus slope beneath a cliff.</p>
</div></div>

<p><b>Talus.</b>&mdash;Wherever the earth’s surface rises in steep cliffs, the
rock fragments derived from frost action, or by other processes of
disintegration, as they become detached either fall or slide rapidly
downward until arrested upon a flatter slope. Upon the earlier
accumulations of this kind, the later ones are deposited, until their
surface slopes up to the cliff face as steeply as the material will lie&mdash;the
angle of repose. Such débris accumulations at the base of
a cliff (<a href="#f158">Fig. 158</a>) are known as <i>talus</i>, and the slope is described as
a talus slope, or in Scotland as a “scree.”</p>

of chipped rock fragments upon a slope,
Snow Hill Island, West Antarctica (after
Otto Nordenskiöld).</p>
</div></div>

<p><b>Soil flow in the continued presence of thaw water.</b>&mdash;So soon
as the rocks are broken down by the weathering processes, they are
easily moved, usually to lower levels. In part this transportation
may be accomplished by gravity slowly acting upon the disintegrated
rock and causing
it to creep down the slope.
Yet even in such cases
water is usually present
in quantity sufficient to fill
the spaces between the
grains, and so act as a
lubricant to facilitate the
migration.</p>

<p>Upon a large scale rocks
which were either originally
incoherent or have
been made so by weathering,
after they have become
saturated with
water, may start into sudden motion as great landslides or avalanches,
which in the space of a few moments materially change the
face of the country, and by burying the bottom lands leave disaster
and misery in their wake.</p>

</div></div>

<p>Within the subpolar regions, where a large part of the surface
is for much of the year covered with snow, the underlying rocks
are for long periods saturated with thaw water, and in alternation
are repeatedly frozen and thawed. Essentially similar conditions
are met with in the high, snow-capped mountains of temperate or
torrid regions. For the subpolar regions particularly it is now
generally recognized that somewhat special processes of soil flow,
described under the name <i>solifluction</i>, are characteristic. The
exact nature of these processes is as yet imperfectly understood, but
there can be little doubt concerning the large rôle which they have
played in the transportation of surface materials. Such soil flow
is clearly manifested under different aspects, and it is likely that
by this comprehensive term distinct processes have been brought
together.</p>

prying its sections apart.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Possibly the most striking aspect of the soil flow in subpolar
regions is furnished by the remarkable “stone rivers” and “rock<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
glaciers”; though the more generally characteristic are peculiar
stripings or other markings which appear upon the surface of the
ground and thus betray the
movements of the underlying
materials. Upon slopes it is
not uncommon for the surface
to be composed of angular rock
fragments riven by the frost
and crossed by broad parallel
furrows as though a gigantic
plow had gone over it (<a href="#f159">Fig. 159</a>).
The direction of the furrows is always up and down the
slope, and the striping is marked in proportion
as the slope is steep. Where the
bottom is reached, the furrows are replaced
by a sort of mosaic pavement
of hexagonal repeating figures, each of
which may be an area of the surface six
feet or more across (<a href="#f160">Fig. 160</a>, and <a href="#f390">Fig. 390</a>, <a href="#Page_368">p. 368</a>).
The depressions which
separate the “blocks” of the pavement
are often filled with clay, while the inclosed
surfaces are made up of coarsely
chipped stone.</p>

<p><b>The splitting wedges of roots and trees.</b>&mdash;In the mechanical
breakdown of the rocks
within humid regions a
not unimportant part is
sometimes taken by the
trees, which insinuate the
tenuous extremities of their
rootlets into the smallest
cracks and by continued
growth slowly wedge even
the firmer rocks apart (<a href="#f161">Fig. 161</a>).
In a similar manner
the small tree trunk growing
within a crevice of the
rock may in time split its parts asunder (<a href="#f162">Fig. 162</a>).</p>

<p><b>The rock mantle and its shield in the mat of vegetation.</b>&mdash;Through
the action of weathering, the rocks, as we have seen,
lose their integrity within a surface layer, which, though it may be
as much as a hundred feet or more
in thickness, must still be accounted
a mere film above the underlying bed
rock. The mechanical agents of the
breakdown operate only within a few
feet of the surface, and the agents of
rock decomposition, derived as they
are from the atmosphere, become
inert before they have descended to
any considerable depth. The surface
layer of incoherent rock is usually
referred to as the <i>rock mantle</i> (<a href="#f163">Fig. 163</a>).
Where the rock mantle is relatively
deep, as it is in the states
south of the Ohio in the eastern
United States, there is found, deep
below the outer layer of soil, a partially decomposed and disintegrated
rock, of which the unaltered minerals lie unchanged in
position but separated by the new minerals which have resulted
from the breakdown of their more
susceptible associates. While thus
in a certain sense possessing the
original structure, this altered material
is essentially incoherent and
easily succumbs to attack by the
pick and spade, so that it is only
at considerably greater depths
that the unaltered rock is encountered.</p>

</div></div>

<p>Because of the tendency of
mantle rock to creep down upon
slopes it is generally found thicker
upon the crests and at the bases of hills and thinnest upon their
slopes (<a href="#f164">Fig. 164</a>).</p>

<p>In the transformation of the upper portion of the mantle rock
into soil, additional chemical processes to those of weathering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
are carried through by the agency of earthworms, bacteria, and
other organisms, and by the action of humus and other acids derived
from the decomposition of vegetation. The bacteria particularly
play a part in the formation of carbonates, as they do
also in changing
the nitrogen of
the air into nitrates
which become
available
as plant food.
Within the
humid tropical
regions ants and other insects enter as a large factor in rock
decomposition, as they do also in producing not unimportant
surface irregularities.</p>

</div></div>

<p>How important is the cover of vegetation in retaining the rock
mantle and the upper soil layer in their respective positions, as
required for agricultural purposes, may be best illustrated by the
disastrous consequences of allowing it to be destroyed. Wherever,
by the destruction of forests, by the excessive grazing of animals,
or by other causes, the mat of turf has been destroyed, the surface
is opened in gullies by the first hard rain, and the fertile layer
of soil is carried from the slopes and distributed with the coarser
mantle upon the bottom lands. Thus the face of the country is
completely transformed from fertile hills into the most desolate
of deserts where no spear of grass is to be seen and no animal food
to be obtained (plate 5 A). The soil once washed away is not again
renewed, for the continuation of the gullying process now effectively
prevents its accumulation.</p>

<p class="pch">THE LIFE HISTORIES OF RIVERS</p>

<p><b>The intricate pattern of river etchings.</b>&mdash;The attack of the
weather upon the solid lithosphere destroys the integrity of its
surface layer, and through reducing it to rock débris makes it the
natural prey of any agent competent to carry it along the surface.
We have seen how, for short distances, gravity unaided may pile
up the débris in accumulations of talus, and how, when assisted by
thaw water which has soaked into the material, it may accomplish
a slow migration by a peculiar type of soil flow. Yet far more
potent transporting agencies are at work, and of these the one of
first importance is running water. Only in the hearts of great
deserts or in the equally remote white deserts of the polar regions
is the sound of its murmurings never heard. Every other part of
the earth’s surface has at some time its running water coursing
in valleys which it has itself etched into the surface. It is this
etching out of the continents in an intricate pattern of anastomosing
valleys which constitutes the chief difference between the land
surface and the relatively even floor of the oceans.</p>


<p><b>The motive power of rivers.</b>&mdash;Every river is born in throes
of Mother Earth by which the land is uplifted and left at a higher
level than it was before. It is the difference of elevation thus
brought about between separated portions of the land areas that
makes it possible for the water which falls upon the higher portions
to descend by gravity to the lower. This natural “head” due to
differences of elevation is the motive power of the local streams,
and for each increase in elevation there is an immediate response
in renewed vigor of the streams. The elevated area off which the
rivers flow is here termed an upland.</p>

<p>The velocity of a stream will be dependent not only upon the
difference in altitude between its source and its mouth, but upon
the distance which separates them, since this will determine the
grade. The level of the mouth being the lowest which the stream<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
can reach is termed the <i>base level</i>, and the current is fixed by the
slope or declivity. The capacity to lift and transport rock débris
is augmented at a quite surprising rate with every increase in
current velocity, the law being that the weight of the heaviest
transportable fragment varies with the sixth power of the velocity
of the current. Thus if one stream flows twice as rapidly as
another, it can transport fragments which are sixty-four times as
heavy.</p>


<p><b>Old land and new land.</b>&mdash;The uplifts of the continents may
proceed without changes in the position of the shore lines, in
which case areas, already carved by streams but no longer actively
modified by them, are worked upon by tools freshly sharpened
and driven by greater power. The land thus subjected to active
stream cutting is described as old land, and has already had
engraved upon it the characteristic pattern of river etchings,
albeit the design has been in part effaced.</p>

<p>If, upon the other hand, the shore line migrates seaward with
the uplift, a portion of the relatively even sea floor, or new land,
is elevated and laid under the action of the running water.
As we are to see, stream cutting is to some extent modified when
a river pattern is inherited from the uplift. The uplift, whether
of old land only or of both old land and new land, marks the
starting point of a new river history, usually described as an
<i>erosion cycle</i>.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

     <div class="caption"><p class="pc400"><span class="smcap">Fig. 165.</span>&mdash;Two successive forms of gullies from the earliest stage of a
river’s life (after Salisbury and Atwood).</p>
</div></div>

<p><b>The earlier aspects of rivers.</b>&mdash;Though geologists have sometimes
regarded the uplift of the continents as a sort of upwarping
in a continuous curved surface, the discussions of river histories
and the pictorial illustrations of them have alike clearly assumed
that the uplift has been essentially in blocks and that the elevated
area meets the lower lying country or the sea in a more or
less definite escarpment. The first rivers to develop after the
uplift may be described as gullies shaped by the sudden downrush
of storm waters and spaced more or less regularly along the
margin of the escarpment (<a href="#f165">Fig. 165</a>). These gullies are relatively
short, straight, and steep; they have precipitous walls and few,
if any, tributaries.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-207b.jpg" width="400" height="305" id="f166"

         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pc400"><span class="smcap">Fig. 166.</span>&mdash;Partially dissected upland (after Salisbury and
Atwood).</p>
</div></div>

<p>With time the gully heads advance into the upland as they
take on tributaries; and so at length they in part invest it and
dissect it into numerous irregularly bounded and flat-topped
tables which are separated by cañons (<a href="#f166">Fig. 166</a>). At the same
time the grade of the channel is becoming flatter, and its precipitous
walls are being replaced by curving slopes, as will be more
fully described in the sequel. It is because of this progressive
reduction of grades with increasing age that the early stages of
a river’s life are much the most turbulent of its history. The
water then rushes down the steep grades in rapids, and is often
at times opened out in some basin to form a lake where differences
of uplift have been characteristic of neighboring sections.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
For several reasons such basins in the course of a stream are relatively
short lived (Chapter XXX), and they disappear with the
earlier stages of the river history.</p>


<p><b>The meshes of the river network.</b>&mdash;From the continued throwing
out of new tributaries by the streams, the meshes in the
river network draw more closely together as the stages of its history
advance. The closeness of texture which is at last developed
upon the upland is in part determined by the quantity of rainfall,
so that in New Jersey with heavy annual precipitation the meshes
in the network are much smaller than they are, for example,
upon the semiarid or arid plains of the western United States.
Its design will, however, in either case more or less clearly express
the plan of rock architecture which is hidden beneath the surface
(<a href="#Page_223">Chapter XVII</a>).</p>


<p><b>The upper and lower reaches of a river contrasted.</b>&mdash;From
the fact that the river progressively invades new portions of the
upland and lays the acquired sections under more and more
thorough investment, it has near its headwaters for a long time
a frontier district which may be regarded as youthful even though
the sections near its mouth have reached a somewhat advanced
stage. The newly acquired sections of river valley may thus
possess the steep grade and precipitous walls which are characteristic
of early gullies and cañons and are in contrast with
the more rounded and flat-bottomed sections below. Lateral
streams, from the fact that they are newer than the main or trunk
stream to which they are tributary, likewise descend upon somewhat
steeper grades (<a href="#f167">Fig. 167</a>).</p>

     <div class="caption"><p class="pc400"><span class="smcap">Fig. 167.</span>&mdash;Characteristic longitudinal sections of the upper portion of a river
valley and its tributaries (after scaled sections by Nussbaum).</p>
</div></div>

<p><b>The balance between degradation and aggradation.</b>&mdash;We have
seen that the power to transport rock fragments is augmented at
a most surprising rate with every increase in the current velocity.
While the lighter particles of rock may be carried as high up as
the surface of the water, the heavier ones are moved forward
upon the bottom with a combined rolling and hopping motion
aided by local eddies. Those particles which come in contact<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
with the bottom or sides of the channel abrade its surface so as
ever to deepen and widen the valley. This cutting accomplished
by partially suspended débris in rapidly moving currents of water is
known as <i>corrasion</i> and the stream is said to be <i>incising</i> its valley.</p>

<p>As the current is checked upon the lower and flatter grades,
some of its load of sediment, and especially the coarser portion,
will be deposited and so partially fill in the channel. A nice
balance is thus established between <i>degradation</i> and the contrasted
process known as <i>aggradation</i>. The older the river valley
the flatter become the grades at any section of its course, and
thus the point which separates the lower zone of aggradation
from the upper one of degradation moves steadily upstream with
the lapse of time.</p>


<p><b>The accordance of tributary valleys.</b>&mdash;It is a consequence of
the great sensitiveness of stream corrasion to current velocity
that no side stream may enter the trunk valley at a level above
that of the main stream&mdash;the tributary streams enter the trunk
stream <i>accordantly</i>. Each has carved its own valley, and any
abrupt increase in gradient of the side streams near where they
enter the main stream would have increased the local corrasion
at an accelerated rate and so have cut down the channel to the
level of the trunk stream.</p>


<p><b>The grading of the flood plain.</b>&mdash;All rivers are subject to
seasonal variations in the volume of their waters. Where there
are wet and dry seasons these differences are greatest, and for a
large part of the year the valleys in such regions may be empty
of water, and are in fact often utilized for thoroughfares. In the
temperate climates of middle latitudes rivers are generally flooded
in the spring when the winter snows are melted, though they
may dwindle to comparatively small streams during the late
summer. In the upper reaches of the river the current velocities
are such that the usual river channel may carry all the water of
flood time; but lower down and in the zone of aggradation, where
the current has been checked, the level of the water rises in flood
above the banks of its usual channel and spreads over the surrounding
lowlands. As a deposit of sediment is spread upon the
surface, the succession of the annual deposits from this source
raises the general level as a broad floor described as the <i>flood plain</i>
of the river.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>


<p><b>The cycles of stream meanders.</b>&mdash;The annual flooding with
water and simultaneous deposition of silt is not, however, the
only grading process which is in operation upon the flood plain.
It is characteristic of swift currents that their course is maintained
in relatively straight lines because of the inertia of the
rapidly moving water. In proportion as their currents become
sluggish, rivers are turned aside by the smallest of obstructions;
and once diverted from their straight course, a law of nature
becomes operative which increases the curvature of the stream
at an accelerated rate up to a critical point, when by a change,
sudden and catastrophic, a new and direct course is taken, to be
in its turn carried through a similar cycle of changes. This
so-called <i>meandering</i> of a stream is accompanied by a transfer of
sediment from one bend or meander of the river to those below
and from one bank to the other. Inasmuch as the later meanders
cross the earlier ones and in time occupy all portions of the plain
to the same average extent, a process of rough grading is accomplished
to which the annual overflow deposit is supplementary.</p>

</div></div>

<p>The course of the current in consecutive meanders and the
cross sections of the channel which result directly from the meandering
process will be made clear from examination of <a href="#f168">Fig. 168</a>.
So soon as diverted from its direct course, the current, by its
inertia of motion, is
thrown against the
outer or convex side
so as to scour or
corrade that bank.
Upon the concave
or inner side of the
curve there is in consequence
an area of
slack water, and here
the silt scoured from higher meanders is deposited. The scouring
of the current upon the outer bank and the filling upon the inner
thus gives to the cross section of the stream a generally unsymmetrical
character (<a href="#f168">Fig. 168 <i>ab</i></a>). Between meanders near the
point of inflection of the curve, and there only, the current is centered
in the middle of the channel and the cross section is symmetrical
(<a href="#f168">Fig. 168 <i>cd</i></a>).</p>

</div></div>

<p>The scour upon the convex side of a meander causes the river
to swing ever farther in that direction, and through invasion of
the silted flood plain to migrate across it. Trees which lie in its
path are undermined and fall outward
in the stream with tops directed
with the current (<a href="#f169">Fig. 169</a>).
Whenever the flood plain is forested,
the fallen trees may be so
numerous as to lie in ranks along
the shore, and at the time of the
next flood they are carried downstream
to jam in narrow places
along the channel and give the erroneous
impression that the flood
has itself uprooted a section of forest
(see <a href="#Page_418">p. 418</a>).</p>

positions of stream
meanders and the

point near the sharpest
curvature.</p>
</div></div>

<p><b>The cut-off of the meander.</b>&mdash;As
the meander swings toward its extreme position it becomes
more and more closely looped. Adjacent loops thus approach
nearer and nearer to each other, but in the successive positions
a nearly stationary point is established near where the river
makes its sharpest turn (<a href="#f170">Fig. 170, <i>G</i></a>, and
<a href="#f454">Fig. 454</a>, <a href="#Page_417">p. 417</a>). At length the neck of land
which separates meanders is so narrow that
in the next freshet a temporary jamming of
logs within the channel may direct the waters
across the neck, and once started in the new
direction a channel is scoured out in the
soft silt. Thus by a breaking through of
the bank of the stream, a so-called “crevasse”,
the river suddenly straightens its
course, though up to this time it has steadily
become more and more sharply serpentine.
After the cut-off has occurred, the old channel
may for a time continue to be used by the
stream in common with the new one, but the advantage in velocity
of current being with the cut-off, the old channel contains slacker
water and so begins to fill with silt both at the beginning and
the end of the loop. Eventually closed up at both ends, this loop<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
or “ox-bow” is entirely separated from the new channel, and
once abandoned of the stream is transformed into an ox-bow
lake (<a href="#f171">Fig. 171</a> and <a href="#Page_415">p. 415</a>).</p>

<p><b>Meander scars.</b>&mdash;Swinging as it occasionally does in its
meanderings quite across the flood plain and against the bank of
the earlier degrading river in
this section, the meander at
times scours the high bank
which bounds the flood plain,
and undermining it in the same
manner, it excavates a recess
of amphitheatral form which is
known as a meander <i>scar</i> (<a href="#f172">Fig. 172</a>).
At length the entire bank
is scarred in this manner so as
to present to the stream a series of concave scallops separated by
sharp intermediate salients of cuspate form.</p>

</div></div>

<p><b>River terraces.</b>&mdash;Whenever the river’s history is interrupted
by a small uplift, or the base level is for any reason lowered, the
stream at once begins to sink its channel into the flood plain.
Once more flowing upon a low grade, it again meanders, and so
produces new walls at a lower level, but formed, like the first, of
intersecting meander scars. Thus there is produced a new flood
plain with cliff and terrace
above, which is
known as a <i>river terrace</i>.
A succession of uplifts
or of depressions of the
base level yields terraces
in series, as they appear
schematically represented
in <a href="#f172">Fig. 172</a>. Such terraces
are to be found well developed upon most of our larger
rivers to the northward of the Ohio and Missouri. The highest
terrace is obviously the remnant of the earliest flood plain, as the
lowest represents the latest.</p>

<p><b>The delta of the river.</b>&mdash;As it approaches its mouth the river
moves more and more sluggishly over the flat grades, and swings
in broader meanders as it flows. Yet it still carries a quantity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
of silt which is only laid down after its current has been stopped
on meeting the body of standing water into which it discharges.
If this be the ocean, the salinity of the sea water greatly aids in a
quick precipitation of the finest material. This clarifying effect
upon the water of the dissolved salt may be strikingly illustrated
by taking two similar jars, the one filled with fresh and the other
with salt water, and stirring the same quantity of fine clay into
each. The clay in the salt water is deposited and the water
cleared long before the murkiness of the other has disappeared.</p>

<p>By the laying down of the residue of its burden of sediment
where it meets the sea, the river builds up vast plains of silt and
clay which are known as deltas and which often form large local
extensions of the continents into the sea. Whereas in its upper
reaches the river with its tributary streams appears in the plan
like a tree and its branches, in the delta region the stream, by
dividing into diverging channels called distributaries (<a href="#f458">Fig. 458</a>,
<a href="#Page_420">p. 420</a>), completes the resemblance to the tree by adding the
roots. From the divergence of the distributaries upon the delta
plain the Greek capital letter Δ is suggested and has supplied the
name for these deposits. Of great fertility, the delta plains of
rivers have become the densely populated regions of the globe,
among which it is necessary to mention only the delta of the
Nile in Egypt, those of the Ganges and Brahmaputra in India,
and those of the Hoang and Yangtse rivers in China.</p>


<p><b>The levee.</b>&mdash;When the snows thaw upon the mountains at
the headwaters of large rivers, freshets result and the delta regions
are flooded. At such times heavily charged with sediment, a
thin deposit of fertile soil is left upon the surface of the delta
plain, and in Egypt particularly this is depended upon for the
annual enrichment of the cultivated fields. Though at this time
the waters spread broadly over the plain, the current still continues
to flow largely within the normal channel, so that the slack water
upon either side becomes the locus for the main deposit of the
sediment. There is thus built up on either side of the channel a
ridge of silt which is known as a <i>levee</i>, and this bank is steadily
increased in height from year to year (<a href="#f452">Fig. 452</a>).</p>

<p>To prevent the danger of floods upon the inhabited plains,
artificial levees are usually raised upon the natural ones, and in a
country like Holland, such levees (dikes) involve a large expenditure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
of money and no small degree of engineering skill and experience
to construct. So important to the life of the nation is
the proper management of its dikes, that in the past history of
China each weak administration has been marked by the development
of graft in this important department and by floods which
have destroyed the lives of hundreds of thousands of people.</p>

of the Mississippi River.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Wherever there has been a markedly rapid sinking upon a
delta region, and depressions are common in delta territory, no
doubt as a result of the loading down
of the crust, the river may present the
paradoxical condition of flowing at a
higher level than the surrounding country.
Between the levees of neighboring
distributaries there are peculiar saucer-shaped
depressions of the country which
easily become filled with water. At the
extremity of the delta the levee may be
the only land which shows above the
ocean surface, and so present the peculiar
“bird-foot” outline which is characteristic of the extremity
of the Mississippi delta, though other processes than the mere
sinking of the deposits may contribute to this result (<a href="#f173">Fig. 173</a>).</p>


<p><b>The sections of delta deposits.</b>&mdash;If now we leave the plan of
the delta to consider the section of its deposits, we find them so
characteristic as to be easily recognized. Considered broadly,
the delta advances seaward after the manner of a railroad embankment
which is being carried across a lake. Though the greater
portion of the deposit is unloaded upon a steep slope at the front,
a smaller amount of material is dropped along the way, and a
layer of extremely fine material settles in advance as the water
clears of its finely suspended particles (<a href="#f174">Fig. 174</a>). Simultaneous
deposits within a delta thus comprise a nearly horizontal layer
of coarser materials, the so-called top-set bed; the bulk of the
deposit in a forward sloping layer, the so-called fore-set bed;
and a thin film of clay which is extended far in advance, the
bottom-set bed (<a href="#f174">Fig. 174, 2</a>). If at any point a vertical section is
made through the deposits, beds deposited in different periods
are encountered; the oldest at the bottom in a horizontal position,
the next younger above them and with forward dip, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
youngest and coarsest upon the top in nearly horizontal position
(<a href="#f174">Fig. 174, 3</a>).</p>

as exhibited in section.</p>
</div></div>

<p>It has been estimated that the surface of the United States
is now being pared down by erosion at the average rate of an
inch in 760 years.
The derived material
is being
deposited in the
flood plain and
delta regions of its
principal rivers.
Some 513 million
tons of suspended
matter is in the
United States carried
to tidewater
each year, and
about half as much
more goes out to
sea as dissolved
matter. If this
material were removed
from the
Panama Canal cutting, an 85-foot sea-level canal would be excavated
in about 73 days. The Mississippi River alone carries
annually to the sea 340 million tons of suspended matter, or
two thirds of the entire amount removed from the area of the
United States as a whole. It is thus little wonder that great
deltas have extended their boundaries so rapidly and that the
crust is so generally sinking beneath the load.</p>

<p class="pch">EARTH FEATURES SHAPED BY RUNNING WATER</p>

<p><b>The newly incised upland and its sharp salients.</b>&mdash;The successive
stages of incising, sculpturing, and finally of reducing an
uplifted land area, are each of them possessed of distinctive
characters which are all to be read either from the map or in the
lines of the landscape. Upon the newly uplifted plain the incising
by the young rivers is to be found chiefly in the neighborhood
of the margins. In this stage the valleys are described as
<span class="font">V</span>-shaped cañons, for the valley wall meets the upland surface
in sharp salients (<a href="#p12a">plate 12 A</a>), and the lines of the landscape are
throughout made up from straight elements. Though the landscapes
of this stage present the grandest scenery that is known
and may be cut out in massive proportions, often with rushing
river or placid lake to enhance the effect of crag and gorge, they
lack the softness and grace of
outline which belong only to the
maturer erosion stages. The
grand cañon of the Colorado
presents the features characteristic
of this stage in the grandest
and most sublime of all examples,
and the castled Rhine is a
gorge of rugged beauty, carved
out from the newly elevated
plateau of western Prussia,
through which the water swirls in eddying rapids (<a href="#f175">Fig. 175</a>).</p>

plain which forms the hill tops.</p>
</div></div>

<p><b>The stage of adolescence.</b>&mdash;As the upland becomes more
largely invaded as a consequence of the headward advance of
the cañons and their sending out of tributary side cañons, the
sharp angles in which the cañon walls intersect the plain become
gradually replaced by well-rounded shoulders. Thus the lines in
the landscape of this stage are a combination of the straight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
line with a simple curve convex toward the sky (<a href="#f176">Fig. 176</a>). In
this stage large sections of the original plateau remain, though
cut into small areas by the extensions
of the tributary valleys.</p>

plateau in West Virginia.</p>
</div></div>

<p><b>The maturely dissected upland.</b>&mdash;Continued
ramifications
by the rivers eventually divide
the entire upland area into separated
parts, and the rounding
of the shoulders of valleys proceeds
simultaneously until of the
original upland no easily recognizable
compartments are to be found. Where before were flat
hilltops are now ridges or watersheds, the well-known <i>divides</i>.
The upland is now said to be completely dissected or to have
arrived at <i>maturity</i>. The streams are still vigorous, for they
make the full descent from the upland level to base level, and
yet a critical turning point of
their history has been reached,
and from now on they are to
show a steady falling off in efficiency
as sculpturing agents.</p>

upland from one of its hilltops, Klamath
Mountains, California (after a
photograph by Fairbanks).</p>
</div></div>

<p>Viewed from one of the hilltops,
the landscape of this stage
bears a marked resemblance to
a sea in which the numberless
divides are the crests of billows, and these, as distance reduces
their importance in the landscape, fade away into the even line
of the horizon (<a href="#f177">Fig. 177</a>).</p>

<p><b>The Hogarthian line of beauty.</b>&mdash;Since the youthful stage of
the upland, when the lines of its landscape were straight, its
character rugged, and its rivers wild and turbulent, there has
been effected a complete transformation. The only straight line
to be seen is the distant horizon, for the landscape is now molded
in softened outlines, among which there is a repeated recurrence
of the line of beauty made famous by Hogarth in his “Analysis of
Beauty.” As well known to all art students, this is a sinuous
line of reversed or double curvature&mdash;a curve which passes
insensibly at a point of inflection from convex to concave (<a href="#f178">Fig. 178)</a>.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
The curve of beauty is now found in every section of the
hills, and it imparts to the landscape a gracefulness and a measure
of restfulness as well, which are not to be found in the landscapes
of earlier stages in the erosion cycle. In the bottoms of the
valleys also the initial windings of the
rivers within their narrow flood plains
add silver beauty lines which stand
out prominently from the more somber
background of the hills.</p>

<p>Considered from the commercial
viewpoint, the mature upland is one
of the least adaptable as a habitation for highly civilized man.
Direct lines of communication run up hill and down dale in
monotonous alternation, and almost the only way of carrying a
railroad through the region, without an expenditure for trestles
which would be prohibitive, is to follow the tortuous crest of a
main divide or the equally winding bed of one of the larger valleys.</p>

<p><b>The final product of river sculpture&mdash;the peneplain.</b>&mdash;When
maturity has been reached in the history of a river, its energies
are devoted to a paring down of the valley slopes and crests so
as to reduce the general level. From this time on hill summits
no longer fall into a common level&mdash;that of the original upland&mdash;for
some mount notably higher than others, and with increasing
age such differences become accentuated. There is now also
a larger aggradation of the valleys to form the level floors of
flood plains, out of which at length the now slight elevations rise
upon such gentle slopes that the process of land sculpture approaches
its end. Gradually
the vigor of the stream has
faded away, and can now only
be renewed through a fresh
uplift of the land, or, what
would amount to the same
thing, a depression of the base
level. Upland and river have
reached old age together, and
the approximation to a new
plain but little elevated above base level is so marked that the
name <i>peneplain</i> is applied to it. Scattered elevations, which because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
of some favoring circumstance rise to greater heights above
the general level of the peneplain, are known as <i>monadnocks</i> after
the type example of Mount Monadnock in New Hampshire (<a href="#f179">Fig. 179</a>).</p>

valleys for the different stages of the erosion cycle.</p>
</div></div>

<p><b>The river cross sections of successive stages.</b>&mdash;To the successive
stages of a river’s life it has been common to carry over
the names from the well-marked periods of a human life. If
neglecting for the moment the general aspect of the upland, we
fix our attention upon
the characteristic
cross sections of the
river valley, we find
that here also there
are clearly marked
characters to distinguish
each stage of the
river’s life (<a href="#f180">Fig. 180</a>).
In infancy the steep,
narrow, and sharp-angled
cañon is a characteristic;
with youth
the wider <span class="font">V</span>-form has already developed; in adolescence the angles
of the cañon are transformed into well-rounded shoulders, and the
valley broadens so as in the lower reaches to lay down a flood
plain; in maturity the divides and the double curves of the line
of beauty appear; while in the decline of old age the valleys are
extremely broad and flat and are floored by an extended flood
plain.</p>


<p><b>The entrenchment of meanders with renewed uplift.</b>&mdash;Upon
the reduced grades which are characteristic of the declining stage
of a river’s life, the current has little power to modify the surface
configuration. On the old land of this stage a renewed uplift
starts the streams again into action. This infusion of driving
power into moving water, regarded as a machine capable of accomplishing
certain work, is like winding up a clock that has
run down. Once more the streams acquire a velocity sufficient
to enable them to cut their valleys into the land surface, and
so a new erosional cycle may be inaugurated upon the old land
surface&mdash;the peneplain. After such an uplift has been accomplished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
and the rivers have sunk their early valleys within the
new upland, we may look out from this now elevated surface
and the eye take in but a single horizontal line, since we view
the plain along its edge.</p>

(after George Otis Smith).</p>
</div></div>

<p>By the uplift the meanders of the earlier rivers may become
entrenched in the new upland, the wide lobes of the individual
meanders being now separated by mountains where before had
been plains of silt only. The New River of the Cumberland
plateau and the Yakima River of central Washington (<a href="#f181">Fig. 181</a>)
furnish excellent American examples of intrenched meanders, as
the Moselle River does in Europe. Upon the course of the latter
river near the town of Zell a tunnel of the railroad a quarter of
a mile in length pierces a mountain in the neck of a meander
lobe in which the river itself travels a distance of more than six
miles in order to make the same advance. The Kaiser Wilhelm
tunnel in the same district penetrates a larger mountain included
in a double meander of the river. Although intrenched, river
meanders are still competent to scour and so undermine the
outer bank, and with favoring conditions they may by this process
erode extended “bottoms” out of the plateau. (See Lockport
quadrangle, U. S. G. S.)</p>

<p><b>The valley of the rejuvenated river.</b>&mdash;Whenever a new uplift
occurs before an erosional cycle has been completed, the rivers
become intrenched, not in a peneplain, but in the bottoms of
broad valleys. The sweeping curves which characterize mature<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
landscapes may thus be brought into striking contrast with the
straight lines of youthful cañons which with <span class="font">V</span>-sections descend
from their lowest levels
(<a href="#f182">Fig. 182</a>). The full
cross section of such a
valley shows a central <span class="font">V</span>
whose sharp shoulders
are extended outward
and upward in the softened
curves of later erosion
stages.</p>

</div></div>


<p><b>The arrest of stream
erosion by the more resistant
rocks.</b>&mdash;The capacity
of a river to erode and carry away the rock material
that lies along its course is dependent not only upon the velocity
of the current, but also upon the hardness, the firmness
of texture, and the solubility of the material. Particularly in
arid and semiarid regions, where no mantle of vegetation is at
hand to mask the surfaces of the firmer rock masses, differences
of this kind are stamped deeply upon the landscape. The rock
terraces in the Grand Cañon of the Colorado together represent
the stronger rock formations of the region, while sloping talus
accumulations bury the weaker beds from sight.</p>

     <div class="cf"><p class="pc200"><span class="smcap">Fig. 183.</span>&mdash;Plan of a river narrows.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Each area of harder rock which rises athwart the course of a
stream causes a temporary arrest in the process of valley erosion
and is responsible for a noteworthy local contraction of the river
valley. The valley is carved less widely as well as less deeply,
and since a river can never corrade
below its base, a “temporary base
level” is for a time established
above the area of harder rock.
Owing to the contraction of the
valley under these conditions, the
locality is described as a river
<i>narrows</i> (<a href="#f183">Fig. 183</a>). The narrows
upon the Hudson River occur in
the Highlands where the river leaves a broad expanse occupied
by softer sediments to traverse an island-like area of hard crystalline<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
rocks. Within the narrows of a river the steep walls, characteristic
of youth and the turbulent current as well, are often retained
long after other portions of the river have acquired the more restful
lines of river maturity. The picturesque crag and the generally
rugged character of river narrows render them points of special
interest upon every navigable river.</p>

</div></div>

<p><b>The capture of one river’s territory by another.</b>&mdash;The effect
of a hard layer of rock interposed in the course of a stream is
thus always to delay the advance of the erosional process at all
levels above the obstruction. When a stream in incising its
valley degrades its channel through a veneer of softer rocks into
harder materials below, it is technically described as having <i>discovered</i>
the harder layer. Where several neighboring streams flow
by similar routes to their common base level, those which discover
a harder rock will advance their headwaters less rapidly
into the upland and so will be at a disadvantage in extending
their drainage territory. A stream
which is not thus hindered will in the
course of time rob the others of a portion
of their territory, for it is able to
erode its lower reaches nearer to base
level and thus acquire for its upper
reaches, where erosion is chiefly accomplished,
an advantage in declivity. The
divide which separates its headwaters
from those of its less favored neighbor
will in consequence migrate steadily into
the neighbor’s territory. The divide
is thus a sort of boundary wall separating
the drainage basins of neighboring
streams, and any migration must extend
the territory of the one at the expense
of the other. As more and more territory
is brought under the dominion of
the more favored stream, there will come
a time when the divide in its migration
will arrive at the channel of the stream that is being robbed, and
so by a sudden act of annexation draw off all the upper waters
into its own basin. By this <i>capture</i> the stream whose territory has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
been invaded is said to have been <i>beheaded</i>. By this act of <i>piracy</i>
the stronger stream now develops exceptional activity because of
the local steep grades near the point of capture, and with this
newly acquired cutting power the invader is competent to advance
still further and enter the territory of the stream that lies
next beyond. The type of drainage network which results from
repeated captures of this kind is known as “trellis drainage”
(<a href="#f184">Fig. 184</a>), a type well illustrated by the rivers of the southern
Appalachians.</p>

<p>In general it may be said that, other conditions being the
same, of two neighboring streams which have a common base
level, that one which takes the longest route will lose territory
to the other, since it must have the flatter average slope. Stream
capture may thus come about without the discovery of hard
rock layers which are more unfavorable to one stream than another.</p>

<p><b>Water and wind gaps.</b>&mdash;In the Allegheny plateau rivers cross,
the range of harder rocks in deep mountain narrows which upon
the horizon appear as gateways through the barrier of the mountain
wall. Such gateways
are sometimes
referred to as “water
gaps”, of which the
Delaware Water Gap
is perhaps the best
known example,
though the Potomac
crosses the Blue
Ridge at the historic
Harper’s Ferry through
a similar portal. The
valley of the tributary
Shenandoah has been the scene of an interesting episode in the
struggle of rival streams which is typical of others in the same
upland region. The records which may be made out from the
landscapes show clearly that in an earlier but recent period,
when the general surface stood at a higher level which has been
called the Kittatinny Plain, the younger Potomac of that time
and a younger but larger ancestor of Beaverdam Creek each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
crossed the Blue Ridge of the time through similar water gaps
(<a href="#f185">Fig. 185, map</a>, and <a href="#f186">Fig. 186</a>). The Potomac of that time was,
however, the more
deeply intrenched,
and possessing an
advantage in slope
it was able to
advance the divide
at the head of its
tributary, the
Shenandoah, into
the territory of Beaverdam Creek. Thus the beheading of the
Beaverdam by the Shenandoah was accomplished (<a href="#f185">Fig. 185, second
map</a>) and its upper waters annexed to the Potomac system.
With the subsequent lowering of the general level of the country
which yielded the present Shenandoah Plain, the former water gap
of Beaverdam Creek was abandoned of its stream at a high level
in the range. Known as Snickers Gap, it may serve as a type of
the “wind gaps” of similar origin which are not altogether uncommon
in the Appalachian Mountain system (<a href="#f186">Fig. 186</a>).</p>

<p><b>Character profiles.</b>&mdash;For humid regions the landscapes possess
characters which, speaking broadly, depend upon the stage of the
erosion cycle. For the earliest stages the straight line enters
as almost the only element in the design; as the cycle advances
to adolescence the rounded forms begin to replace the angles of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
the immature stages, and with full maturity the lines of beauty
alone are characteristic. As this critical stage is passed irregularity
of feature and ever more flattened curves are found to correspond
to the decline of the river’s vital energies. There are
thus marks of senility in the work of rivers (<a href="#f187">Fig. 187</a>).</p>

<p class="pch">THE TRAVELS OF THE UNDERGROUND WATER</p>

<p><b>The descent within the unsaturated zone.</b>&mdash;Of the moisture
precipitated from the atmosphere, that portion which neither
evaporates into the air nor runs off upon the surface, sinks into
the ground and is described as the <i>ground water</i>. Here it descends
by gravity through the pores and open spaces, and at a quite
moderate depth arrives at a zone which is completely saturated
with water. The depth of the upper surface of this saturated zone
varies with the humidity of the climate, with the altitude of the
earth’s surface, and with many other similarly varying factors.
Within humid regions its depth may vary from a few feet to a few
hundred feet, while in desert areas the surface may lie as low as a
thousand feet or more.</p>

<p>The surface of the zone of the lithosphere that is saturated
with water is called the <i>water table</i>, and though less accentuated it
conforms in general to the relief of the country (<a href="#f188">Fig. 188</a>). Its
depth at any point is found from the levels of all perennial streams
and from the levels at which water stands in wells.</p>

and the cause of intermittent streams.</p>
</div></div>

<p>During the season of small precipitation the water table is
lowered, and if at such times it falls below the bed of a valley,
the surface stream within the valley dries up, to be revived when,
after heavier precipitation, the water table has in turn been raised.
Such streams are said to be <i>intermittent</i>, and are especially characteristic
of semiarid regions (<a href="#f188">Fig. 188</a>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p>Wherever in descending from the surface an impervious layer,
such as clay, is encountered, the further downward progress of the
water is arrested. Now conducted in a lateral direction it issues
at the surface as a spring at the line of emergence of the upper surface
of the impervious layer (<a href="#f189">Fig. 189</a>).</p>

water in a lateral direction to issue in surface springs.</p>
</div></div>

<p><b>The trunk channels of descending water.</b>&mdash;While within the
unconsolidated rock materials near the surface of the earth, it is
clear that water can circulate in proportion as the materials are
porous and so relatively pervious. As the pore spaces become
minute and capillary, the difficulty of permeation through the
materials becomes very great. Thus in the noncoherent rocks
it is the coarse gravel and the layers of sand which serve as the
underground channels, while the fine clays have the effect of an
impervious wall upon the circulating waters. In coarse sand as
much as a third of the volume of the material is pore space for the
absorption and transmission of water. Even under these favorable
conditions the movement of the water is exceedingly slow
and usually less than a fifth of a mile a year.</p>

near Chorges in the High Alps, to illustrate the corrosion
of limestone along two series of vertical joints
(after Martel).</p>
</div></div>

<p>Within the hard rocks it is the sandstones which have the largest
pore spaces, but in
nearly all consolidated
rocks there are additional
spaces along
certain of the bedding
planes, the joint openings
(<a href="#f190">Fig. 190</a>), and
the crushed zones of
displacement, so that
these parting planes
become the trunk
channels, so to speak,
of the circulating
water. It is along<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
such crevices that in the course of time the mineral matter carried
in solution by the water is deposited to produce the ore veins
and the associated crystallized minerals.</p>


<p><b>The caverns of limestones.</b>&mdash;Where limestone formations have
a nearly flat upper surface, a large part of the surface water enters
the rock by way of the joint spaces, which it soon widens by solution
into broad crevices with well-rounded shoulders. At joint
intersections solution of the limestone is so favored that the water
may here descend in a sort of vertical shaft until it meets a bedding
plane extending laterally and offering more favorable conditions
for corrosion. Its journey now begins in a lateral direction, and
solution of the rock continuing, a tunnel may be etched out and
extended until another joint is encountered which is favorable to
its further descent into the formation. By this process on alternating
shafts and galleries the water descends to near the surface
of the water table by a series of steps, and is eventually discharged
into the river system of the district (<a href="#f191">Fig. 191</a>). Within the larger
caverns the water at the lowest level
usually flows as a subterranean river
to emerge later into the light from beneath
a rock arch.</p>

     <div class="cf"><p class="ch200"><span class="smcap">Fig. 191.</span>&mdash;Diagram to show the
relation of caverns in limestone
to the river system of the district
and to the “swallow
holes” upon the surface.</p>
</div></div>

<p>From the plan of a system of connecting
caverns it may often be observed
that the galleries of the several
levels are alike directed along two
rectangular directions which indicate
the master joint directions within the limestone formation. This
is especially clear from the map of the galleries in the explored
portions of the Mammoth Cave (<a href="#f192">Fig. 192</a>).</p>


<p><b>Swallow holes and limestone sinks.</b>&mdash;Above the caverns of
limestone formations there are selected points where the water
has descended in the largest volume, and here funnel-shaped
depressions have been dissolved out from the surface of the rock.
In different districts such depressions have become known as
“sinks”, “swallow holes”, <i>entonnoirs</i>, and <i>Orgeln</i>. Wherever the
depressions have a characteristic circular outline, there can be
little doubt that they are the product of solution by the descending
water, and have relatively small connections only with the
subterranean caverns. They have thus naturally collected upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
their bottoms the insoluble clay which was contained in the impure
limestone as well as a certain amount of slope wash from the surface.
Inasmuch as the clays are impervious to water, the bottoms
of these swallow holes are better supplied with moisture than the
surrounding rock surfaces, and
by nourishing a more vigorous
plant growth are strongly impressed
upon the landscape
(<a href="#f193">Fig. 193</a>).</p>

luxuriantly upon the bottoms of sinks
within a limestone country (after a
photograph by H. T. A. de L. Hus).</p>
</div></div>

<p>Certain of the depressions
above caverns are, however,
less regular in outline, and their
bottoms are occupied by a
mass of limestone rubble. In
some instances, at least, these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
depressions appear to be the result of local incaving of the cavern
roofs. An incaving of this nature may close up an earlier gallery in
the cavern and divert the cave waters to a new course. The destruction
of the roofs of caverns through this process of incaving may
continue until only relatively small remnants are left. From long
subterranean tunnels the caves are thus transformed into subaërial
rock bridges that have become known as “natural bridges.” The
best-known American example is the Natural Bridge near Lexington,
Virginia. Much grander natural bridges have been formed
in sandstone by a totally different process, and must not be confused
with these limestone remnants of caverns.</p>


<p><b>The sinter deposits.</b>&mdash;Just as water can dissolve the calcareous
rocks with the formation of caverns, it can under other conditions
deposit the material which has thus been taken into solution.
Its power to hold carbonate of lime in solution is dependent
upon the presence of carbonic acid gas within the water. Water
charged with gas and dissolved lime carbonate is said to be “hard”,
and if the gas be driven off by boiling or otherwise, the dissolved
lime is thrown out of solution and deposited in a form well known
to all housekeepers.</p>

<p>Hard water flowing in a surface stream, if dashed into spray
at a cascade, may deposit its lime carbonate in an ever thickening
veneer wherever the spray is dashed about the falls. This material,
when cut in section, has waving parallel layers and is known as
<i>travertine</i> or <i>calcareous sinter</i>. Some of the most remarkable deposits
of this nature may be seen at the cascade of Tivoli near
Rome, and most of the Roman buildings have been constructed
from travertine that has been quarried in the vicinity.</p>


<p><b>The growth of stalactites.</b>&mdash;Water, after percolating slowly
through the crevices of limestone, where it becomes charged with
the carbonic acid gas and with dissolved carbonate of lime, may
trickle from the roof of a cavern. Emerging from the narrow
crevice, it may give off some of its contained gas and is usually
subject to evaporation, with the result that the lime carbonate is
left adhering to the rock surface from which evaporation took
place. If the water collects upon the cavern roof so slowly that
it can entirely evaporate before a drop can form, the entire content
of carbonate will be left adhering to the roof. Evaporation is
most rapid near the margins and over the center of each drop as it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
develops, and the deposit which is left thus takes the form of tiny
white rings at those points upon the crevice where there is the
easiest passage for the trickling water. To the outer surface of
these rings water will first adhere and then evaporate, as it will
also slowly ooze through the passage in the ring, but here without
evaporation until it reaches the lower surface. A pendant structure
will, therefore, develop, growing outward in all directions by
the deposition of concentric layers which are thickest near the roof,
and downward into the form of a rock “icicle” through evaporation
of the water which collects near the tip. These pendant
sinter formations are known as stalactites and are thus formed of
concentric layers arranged like a series of nested cornucopias with
a perforation of nearly uniform caliber along the axis of the structure
(<a href="#f194">Fig. 194</a>).</p>

manner of formation of stalactites,
stalagmites, and sinter columns
beneath parallel crevices upon the
roofs of caverns (in part after von
Knebel).</p>
</div></div>

<p><b>Formation of stalagmites.</b>&mdash;Wherever the water percolates
through the roof of the cavern so rapidly that it cannot entirely
evaporate upon the roof, a portion
falls to the floor, and, spattering as
it strikes, builds up a relatively
thick cone of sinter known as a
stalagmite, and this is accurately
centered beneath a stalactite upon
the roof. In proportion as the
cavern is high, the dropping water
is widely dispersed as it strikes the
floor, with the formation of a correspondingly
thick and blunt stalagmite.
As this rises by growth toward
the roof, it often develops
upon its summit a distinct crater-like
depression (<a href="#f194">Fig. 194, lower figure</a>). When the process is
long continued, stalactites and stalagmites may grow together
to form columns which may be ranged with their neighbors
like the pipes of an organ, and like them they give out clear
tones when struck lightly with a mallet. At other times the
columns are joined to their neighbors to form hangings and draperies
of the most fantastic and beautiful design (<a href="#f195">Fig. 195</a>).</p>

<p>In remote antiquity limestone caverns afforded a refuge to many
species of predatory birds and animals as well as to our earliest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
ancestors. The bones of all these denizens of the caves lie entombed
within the clays and the sinter formations upon the cavern
floors, and they tell the story of a fierce and long-continued warfare
for the possession of these natural strongholds. The evidence
is clear that these cave men with their primitive weapons were
able at times to drive away the cave bears, lions, and hyenas, and
to set up in the cavern their simple hearths, only in their turn to
be conquered by the ferocity of their enemies. Some of the European
caves have yielded many wagonloads of the skeletons of
these fierce predatory animals, together with the simple weapons
of the primitive man.</p>

<p><b>The Karst and its features.</b>&mdash;Most so-called limestones have a
large admixture of argillaceous materials (clays) and of siliceous
or sandy particles. Such impurities make up the bulk of the clays
and muds which are left behind when the soluble portions of the
limestone have been dissolved.</p>

<p>Swallow holes we have found to be characteristic features within
such districts. When limestones are more nearly pure, as in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
Karst region east of the Adriatic Sea, similar features are developed,
but upon a grander scale, and certain additional forms are
encountered. In place of
the sink or swallow hole,
there appears the “karst
funnel” or <i>doline</i>, a deep,
bowl-shaped depression
having a flat bottom.
Such funnels may be 30
to 3000 feet across and
from 6 to 300 feet in depth
(<a href="#f196">Fig. 196</a>). Though in
one or two instances
known to be the result
of the break down of
cavern roofs (<a href="#f197">Fig. 197</a>),
yet like the swallow holes
of other regions these
larger funnels appear generally
to be the work of
solution by the descending waters. Where they have been opened
in artificial cuttings along railroads or in mines, the original rock
is found intact at the bottom, with
small crevices only going down to
lower levels. Over the bottoms of
the dolines there is spread a layer
of fertile red clay, the <i>terra rossa</i>,
like that which is obtained as a
residue when a fragment of the
limestone has been dissolved in
laboratory experiments.</p>

</div></div>

<p><b>A desert from the destruction of
forests.</b>&mdash;Between the dolines is
found a veritable desert with jutting limestone angles and little
if any vegetation. The water which falls upon the surface either
runs off quickly or goes down to the subterranean caverns by which
so much of the country is undermined. Hence it is that the gardens
which furnish the sustenance for the scattered population
are all included within the narrow limits of the doline bottoms.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
Although to-day so largely a barren waste, we know that the Karst
upon the Adriatic was in remote antiquity a heavily forested region
and that it supplied the myriads of wooden piles upon which
the city of Venice is supported. The vessels which brought to
this port upon the Adriatic its ancient prosperity were built from
wood brought from this tract of modern desert. In the days of
Venetian grandeur the fertile terra rossa formed a veneer upon
the rock surface of the Karst and so retained the surface waters
for the support of the luxuriant forest cover. After deforestation
this veneer of rich soil was washed by the rains into the dolines
or into the few stream courses of the region, thus leaving a barren
tract which it will be all but impossible to reclaim (<a href="#p6a">plate 6 A</a>).</p>

<p>Upon the steeper slopes
over the purer limestones,
the rain water runs away,
guided by the joints within
the rock. There is thus
etched out a more or less
complete network of narrow
channels (<a href="#f190">Fig. 190</a>,
<a href="#Page_181">p. 181</a>), between which the
remnants rise in sharp
blades to produce a structure
often simulated upon
the fissured surface of a
glacier that has been melted in the sun’s rays (<a href="#f401">Fig. 401</a>). These
almost impassable areas of karst country are described as <i>Schratten</i>
or <i>Karrenfelder</i> (<a href="#f198">Fig. 198</a>).</p>


<p><b>The ponore and the polje.</b>&mdash;To-day large areas of the Karst
are devoid of surface streams, nearly all the surface water finding
its way down the crevices of the limestone into caverns, and there
flowing in subterranean courses. The foot traveler in the Karst
country is sometimes suddenly arrested to find a precipice yawning
at his feet, and looking down a well-like opening to the depth
of a hundred feet or more, he may see at the bottom a large river
which emerges from beneath the one wall to disappear beneath
the other. These well-like shafts are in the Austrian Karst known
as <i>Ponores</i>, while to the southward in Greece they are called
<i>Katavothren</i>.</p>

<p>Elsewhere the karst river may emerge from its subterranean
course in a broader depressed area bounded by vertical cliffs, from
which it later disappears beneath the limestone wall. Such depressions
of the karst are known as <i>poljen</i>, and appear in most
cases to be above the downthrown blocks in the intricate fault
mosaic of the region. Some of these steeply walled inclosures
have an area of several hundred square miles, and especially at
the time of the spring snow melting they are flooded with water
and so transformed into seasonal lakes (<a href="#f199">Fig. 199</a> and <a href="#Page_422">p. 422</a>). It
appears that at such times the cave
galleries of the region with their local
narrows are not able to carry off all
the water which is conducted to them;
and in consequence there is a temporary
impounding of the flood waters in
those portions of the river’s course
which are open to the sky and more
extended. The rush of water at such
times may bring the red clay into the
subterranean channels in sufficient
quantity to clog the passages. The
Zirknitz Lake usually has high water
two or three times a year, and exceptionally the flooding has continued
for a number of years. It has thus in some districts been
necessary to afford relief to the population through the construction
of expensive drainage tunnels.</p>

<p>The conditions which are typified in the Karst area to the east
of the Adriatic Sea are encountered also in many other lands; as,
for example, in the Vorarlberg and Swiss Alps, in Lebanon, and
in Sicily.</p>


<p><b>The return of the water to the surface.</b>&mdash;Water which has descended
from the surface and been there held between impervious
layers, may be under the pressure of its own weight or “head”;
and will later find its way upward, it may be to the surface or
higher, where a perforation is discovered in its otherwise impervious
cover. Such local perforations are produced naturally by
lines of fracture or faulting (widened at their intersections),
and artificially through the sinking of deep wells. The water,
which at ordinary times reaches the surface upon fissures, is usually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
concentrated locally at the intersections of the fracture network,
where it issues in lines of fissure springs (<a href="#f200">Fig. 200</a>); but at the time
of earthquakes the water may rise above the surface in lines of
fountains (<a href="#Page_83">p. 83</a>), or occasionally as sheets of water which may
mount some tens of feet into the air.</p>

<div class="floatleft">

lines of rock fracture at intersections,

</div></div>

<p>In contrast to the flow of surface springs, which varies with the
season through wide ranges both in its volume and in temperature
of the water, the volume of
fissure springs is but slightly
affected by the seasonal precipitation,
and the water temperature
is maintained relatively
constant. Rock is but
a poor heat conductor, and the
seasonal temperature changes
descend a few feet only into the
ground. Thus water which
rises from depths of a few hundred
feet only is apt to be icy
cold, while from greater depths
the effect of the earth’s internal
heat is apparent in a uniform
but relatively higher temperature of the water. Such “warm”
or <i>thermal</i> springs are apt to contain considerable mineral matter
in solution, both because the water is far traveled and because its
higher temperature has considerably increased its solvent properties.</p>

<p>It has long been recognized that lines of junction of different
rock formations at the base of mountain ranges are localities favorable
for the occurrence of thermal springs. These junction
lines are usually within zones where by movement upon fractures
the widest openings in the rock have formed, and the catchment
area of the neighboring mountain highland has supplied head for
the ground water. A map of the hot springs within the Great
Basin of the western United States would present in the main a
map of its principal faults.</p>


<p><b>Artesian wells.</b>&mdash;From the natural fissure spring an artesian
well differs in the artificial character of the perforation of the impervious
cover to the water layer. The water of artesian wells
may flow out at the surface under pressure, or it may require<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
pumping to raise it from some lower level. Ideal conditions are
furnished where the geological structure of the district is that of a
broad basin or syncline. The water which falls in a neighboring
upland is here impounded between two parallel, saucer-like walls
and will flow under its head if the upper wall be perforated at
some low level (<a href="#f201">Fig. 201, 3</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter">

clogging of the pervious formation; (3) flowing wells in an artesian basin. The
dotted lines are the water levels within the pervious layers (after Chamberlin).</p>
</div></div>

<p>A monoclinal structure may furnish artesian conditions when
the generally pervious layer has become clogged at a low level so
as to hold back the water (<a href="#f248">Fig. 248, 2</a>). Pumping wells may be
used successfully even when such clogging does not exist, for the
slow-moving underground water flows readily in the direction of
all free outlets (<a href="#f201">Fig. 201, 1</a>).</p>


<p><b>Hot springs and geysers.</b>&mdash;Thermal springs whose temperature
approaches the boiling point of water are known as <i>hot springs</i>.
A <i>geyser</i> is a hot spring which intermittently ejects a column of
water and steam. Both hot springs and geysers are to be found
only in volcanic regions, and appear to be connected with uncooled
masses of siliceous lava. In two of the three known geyser regions,
Iceland and New Zealand, the volcanoes of the neighborhood are
still active, and the lavas of the Yellowstone National Park date
from the quite recent geological period which immediately preceded
the so-called “Ice Age.”</p>

<p>Wherever found, geysers are in the low levels along lines of drainage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
where the underground water would most naturally reappear
at the surface. Their water has penetrated to considerable depths
below the surface, but has been chiefly heated by ascending steam
or other vapors. The water journey has been chiefly made along
fissures, as is shown by the cool springs which often issue near
them. Though some hot springs and geysers may disappear from
a district, others are found to be forming, and there is no good
reason to think that geysers are rapidly dying out, as was at
one time supposed.</p>

<p>The action of a geyser was first satisfactorily explained by the
great German chemist Bunsen after he had made studies of the
Icelandic geysers, and the mechanics of the eruption was later
strikingly illustrated in the laboratory by an artificial geyser constructed
by the Irish physicist Tyndall. In many respects this
action is like that of the Strombolian eruption within a cinder
cone, since it is connected with the viscosity of the fluid and the
resistance which this opposes to the liberation of the developing
vapor. In the case of the geyser, a column of heated water stands
within a vertical tube and is heated near the bottom of the column.</p>

<div class="floatleft">

     <div class="cf"><p class="ch250"><span class="smcap">Fig. 202.</span>&mdash;Cross section of Geysir,
Iceland, with simultaneously observed
temperatures recorded at the
left, and the boiling temperatures for
the same levels at the right (after
Campbell).</p>
</div></div>

<p>Though the water may at its surface have the normal boiling
temperature and be there in quiet ebullition, the boiling point
for all lower levels is raised by the
weight of the column of superincumbent
liquid, and so for a time
the formation of steam within the
mass is prevented. In <a href="#f202">Fig. 202</a>
is shown a cross section of the
Icelandic <i>Geysir</i> from which our
name for such phenomena has been
derived, and to this section have
been added the actual observed
temperatures of the water at the
different levels as well as the temperatures
at which boiling can
take place at these levels. From
this it will be seen that at a depth
of 45 feet the water is but 2° Centigrade below its boiling point.
A slight increase of temperature at this level, due to the constantly
ascending steam, will not only carry this layer above the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
boiling point, but the expansion of the steam within the mass will
elevate the upper layers of the water into zones where the boiling
points are lower, and thus bring about a sudden and violent ebullition
of all these upper portions. Thus is explained the almost
universal observation that just before geysers erupt the hot water
rises in the bowls and generally overflows them.</p>

<div class="floatright">

for simulating geyser
action in the lecture
room (by courtesy
of Professor B.
W. Snow).</p>
</div></div>

<p>The water ejected from the geyser is considerably cooled in the
air; and after its return to the tube must be again heated by the
ascending vapors before another eruption can
occur. The measure of the cooling, the time
necessary to fill the tube, and the supply of
rising steam, all play a part in fixing the period
which separates consecutive eruptions. If the
top of the tube be narrowed from its average
caliber, as is commonly observed to be true of
the geysers within the Yellowstone National
Park, the escape of the steam is further hindered,
and frequent geyser eruption promoted.</p>

<p>An artificial geyser for demonstration of the
phenomenon in the lecture room is represented
in <a href="#f203">Fig. 203</a>. The cut has been prepared from
a photograph of an apparatus designed by
Professor B. W. Snow of the University of
Wisconsin. In this design the tube is contracted
so as to have a top diameter one fourth
only of what it is at the bottom, where heat is
directly applied by multiple Bunsen lamps.
The water once sufficiently heated, this artificial
geyser erupts at regular intervals of time
which are dependent upon the dimensions of
the apparatus and the quantity of heat applied.</p>

<p>In case of natural geysers a considerable
quantity of heat escapes between eruptions in
steam which issues quietly from the bowl of
the geyser. If this heat be retained by plugging the mouth
of the tube with a barrowful of turf, as is sometimes done
with the geyser <i>Strokr</i> in Iceland, eruption is promoted and so
takes place earlier. Another method of securing the same result
is to increase the viscosity of the water through the addition of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
soap, as was accidentally discovered by a Chinaman who was utilizing
the geyser water in the Yellowstone Park for laundry operations.
After this discovery it became a common custom to
“soap” the Yellowstone geysers in order to make them play;
but this method was prohibited under heavy penalty after the disastrous
eruption of the Excelsior Geyser.</p>


<p><b>The deposition of siliceous sinter by plant growth.</b>&mdash;Geysers
are known only from areas of siliceous volcanic lava, and this may
perhaps have its cause in the easier
solution of the geyser tube from
such materials. The silica dissolved
in the heated waters is
<i>again</i> deposited at the surface to
form <i>siliceous sinter</i> or <i>geyserite</i>.
This material forms terraces surrounding
the geysers or is built up
into mounds which are often quite
symmetrical, such as those of the
Bee Hive and Lone Star geysers
of the Yellowstone Park (<a href="#f204">Fig. 204</a>).</p>

<div class="floatleft">

     <div class="cf"><p class="ch250"><span class="smcap">Fig. 204.</span>&mdash;Cone of siliceous sinter
built up about the mouth of the
Lone Star Geyser in the Yellowstone
National Park.</p>
</div></div>

<p>The greater part of this separation
of silica from the heated
geyser waters is due to the action
of plants or algæ that are able
to grow in the boiling waters and which produce the beautiful
colors in the linings to the hot springs. The wonderful variety
of the tints displayed is accounted for by the fact that the algæ
take on different colors at different temperatures. The silica
is deposited from the water in the gelatinous hydrated form, which,
however, dries in the sun to a white sand. The growth within the
pools goes on in a manner similar to that of a coral reef, the algæ
dying below and there becoming encased in the rock lining while
still continuing to grow upon the surface. Whereas sinter of this
nature, when deposited by evaporation alone, can produce a maximum
thickness of layer of a twentieth of an inch each year, the
growth from alga deposition within limited areas may be as much
as eight inches during the same period.</p>

<p class="pch">SUN AND WIND IN THE LANDS OF INFREQUENT
RAINS</p>

<p><b>The law of the desert.</b>&mdash;It is well to keep ever in mind that
there is no universal law which dominates Nature’s processes in
all the sections of her realm. Those changes which, because often
observed, are most familiar, may not be of general application,
for the reason that the areas habitually occupied by highly civilized
races together comprise but a small portion of the earth’s
surface. In the dank tropical jungle, upon the vast arid sand
plains, and in the cold white spaces near the poles, Nature has
instituted peculiar and widely different processes.</p>

<p>The fundamental condition of the desert is aridity, and this
necessitates an exclusion from it of all save the exceptional rain
cloud. Thus deserts are walled in by mountain ranges which
serve as barriers to intercept the moisture-bringing clouds. They
are in consequence saucer-shaped depressions, often with short
mountain ranges rising out of the bottoms, and such rain as falls
within the inclosure is largely upon the borders. Of this rainfall
none flows out from the desert, for the water is largely returned
to the atmosphere through evaporation.</p>

<p>The desert history is thus begun in isolation from the sea from
which the cloud moisture is derived, a balance being struck between
inflow and evaporation. Yet if deserts have no outlets,
it is not true that they have no rivers. These are occasionally
permanent, often periodic, but generally ephemeral and violent.
The characteristic drainage of deserts comes as the immediate
result of sudden cloudburst. As a consequence, the desert stream
flows from the mountain wall choked with sediment, and entering
the depressed basin, is for the most part either sucked down into the
floor or evaporated and returned to the atmosphere. The dissolved
material which was carried in the water is eventually left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
in saline deposits, and the great burden of sediment accumulates
in thick stratified masses which in magnitude outstrip the largest

<p><b>The self-registering gauge of past climates.</b>&mdash;From the initiation
of the desert in its isolation from the lands tributary to the
sea, its history becomes an individual and independent one. An
increasing quantity of rainfall will be marked by larger inflow to
the basin, and the lakes which form in its lowest depression will,
as a consequence, rise and expand over larger areas. A contrary
climatic change will bring about a lowering of the lakes and leave
behind the marks of former shorelines above the water level (<a href="#f205">Fig. 205</a>).
Deserts are thus in a sense self-registering climatic gauges
whose records go back far beyond the historic past. From them
it is learned that there have been alternating periods of larger and
smaller precipitation, which are referred to as <i>pluvial</i> and <i>interpluvial</i>
periods.</p>

<p>From such records it is learned that the Great Basin of the
western United States was at one time occupied by two great desert
lakes, the one in the eastern portion being known as Lake Bonneville
(<a href="#f206">Fig. 206</a>). With the desiccation which followed upon the
series of pluvial periods, which in other latitudes resulted in great
continental glaciers and has become known as the Glacial Period,
this former desert lake dried up to the limits of Great Salt Lake and
a few smaller isolated basins. Between 1850 and 1869 the waters
of Great Salt Lake were rising, while from 1876 to 1890 their level
was falling, though subject to periodic fluctuations, and in recent
years the waters of the lake have risen so high as to pass all records
since the occupation of the country. As a consequence the so-called
Salt Lake “cut-off” of the Union Pacific Railway, constructed
at great expense across a shallow portion of the lake, has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
been overflowed by its waters. The Sawa Lake in the Persian
Desert, which disappeared some five hundred years ago, again
came into existence in 1888 so as to cover the caravan route to
Teheran.</p>

<p>The record in the rocks of the distant past reveals the fact that
in some former deserts barriers were, in the course of time, broken
down, with the result that an invading
sea entered through the breached wall.
The result was the sudden destruction
of land life, the remains of which are
preserved in “bone beds”, now covered
by true marine deposits. A still later
episode of the history was begun when
the sea had disappeared and land animals
again roamed above the earlier
desert. Such an alternation of marine
deposits with the remains of land plants
and animals in the deposits of the Paris
Basin, led the great Cuvier to his belief
that geologic history was comprised of
a succession of cataclysms in which life
was alternately destroyed and re-created
in new forms&mdash;a view which later, under
the powerful influence of Lyell and
Darwin, gave way to that of more
gradual changes and the evolution of
life forms.</p>


<p><b>Some characteristics of the desert
wastes.</b>&mdash;The great stretches of the
arid lands have been often compared to
the ocean, and the Bedouin’s camel is
known as “the ship of the desert.” Though a deceptive resemblance
for the most part, the comparison is not without its value.
Both are closed basins, and it is in this respect that the desert and
the ocean may be said to most resemble each other, for none of
the water and none of the sediment is lost to either except as
boundaries are, with the progress of time, transposed or destroyed.
Flatness of surface and monotony of scenery both have in common,
and the waters and the sand are in each case salt; yet the ocean,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
from the tropics to the poles, has the same salts in essentially the
same proportions, while in the desert the widest variations are
found both in the salts which are present and in their relative
quantities.</p>

<p>Upon the borders of the ocean are found ridges of yellow sand
heaped up by the wind, but these ramparts are small in comparison
to those which in deserts are found upon the borders (<a href="#p7a">plate 7 A</a>).</p>

<p>The desert is a land of geographic paradoxes. As Walther has
pointed out, we have rain in the desert which does not wet, springs
which yield no brooks, rivers without mouths, forests preserved
in stone, lakes without outlets, valleys without streams, lake basins
without lakes, depressions below the level of the sea yet barren
of water, intense weathering with no mantle of disintegrated rock,
a decomposition of the rocks from within instead of from without,
and valleys which branch sometimes upstream and sometimes
down.</p>

<p>Within the deserts curious mushroom-like remnants of erosion
afford a local relief from the searching rays of the desert sun.
Pocket-like openings large enough for a hermit’s habitation are
hollowed out by the wind from the disintegrated rock masses.
Amphitheaters open out from little erosion valleys or wadi, and
isolated outliers of the mountains stand like sentinels before their
massive fronts.</p>

<p>Because of the general absence of clouds above a desert, no
shield such as is common in humid regions is provided against the
blinding intensity of the sun’s rays. Sun temperatures as high
as 180° Fahrenheit have been registered over the deserts of
western Africa. Every one is familiar with the fact that a
blanket of thick clouds is a prevention of frosts at night, for, with
the setting of the sun and the consequent radiation of heat from
the earth, these rays are intercepted by the clouds, returned and
re-returned in many successive exchanges. Over desert regions
the absence of any such blanket of moisture is responsible for the
remarkable falls of temperature at sunset. Though shortly before
temperatures of 100° Fahrenheit or greater may have been
measured, it is not uncommon for water to freeze during the
following night. Much the same conditions of sudden temperature
change with nightfall are experienced in high mountains when
one has ascended above the blanketing clouds.</p>

<p><b>Dry weathering&mdash;the red and brown desert varnish.</b>&mdash;In
desert lands the fierce rays of the sun suck up all the available
moisture, and the water table may be hundreds of feet below the
surface. Roots of trees a hundred feet or more in length have
been found to testify to the
fierce struggle of the desert
plant with the arid conditions.
In humid regions the meteoric
water dissolves the more
soluble sodium salts near the
surface of the rock and carries
them out to the ocean, where
they add to the saltness of the
sea. In the desert the rare
precipitations prevent an outflow,
but the sun’s strong rays suck out with the moisture the
salts from within the rock, and evaporating upon the surface, the
salts are left as a coat of “alkali”, which is in part carried away on
the wind and in part washed off in one of the rare cloudbursts.
In either case these constituents find their way to the lowest depressions
of the basin,
where they contribute
to the saline deposits
of the desert lakes (<a href="#f207">Fig. 207</a>).</p>

</div></div>

<p>Certain of the saline
constituents of the
rocks, as they are thus
drawn out by the sun’s
rays, fuse with the rock
at the surface to form a
dense brown substance
with smooth surface
coat, known as <i>desert
varnish</i>. Within the interior a portion of the salts crystallize
within the capillary fissures, and like water freezing within a pipe,
they rend the walls apart. As a direct consequence of this
disintegrating process the interior of rock masses may crumble
into sand; and if the hard shell of varnish be broken at any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
point, the wind makes its entrance and removes the interior portion
so as to leave a hollow shell&mdash;the characteristic “pocket
rock” (<a href="#f208">Fig. 208</a>) of the desert. The nummulitic limestone of
Mokkatan and many of the great hewn blocks of Egyptian limestone
sound hollow under the tap of the hammer, and when
broken, they reveal a shell a few inches only in thickness (<a href="#f209">Fig. 209</a>).</p>

</div></div>

<p>The brown desert varnish is one of the most characteristic
marks of an arid country. It is found in all deserts under much
the same conditions, and
is especially apt to be present
in sandstone. When
scratched, the surface of
the rock becomes either
cherry-red, indicating anhydrous
ferric oxide, or it
is yellowish, due to the
hydrated iron oxide which
we know as iron rust.
Thus it is seen that the
sands of deserts, in contrast to those yielded by other processes
within humid regions, have a characteristic red color, and this
may vary from brownish red upon the one hand to a rich carmine
upon the other.</p>


<p><b>The mechanical breakdown of the desert rocks.</b>&mdash;The chemical
changes of decomposition within desert rocks are, as we have
seen, largely due to the action of concentrated solutions of salts
at high temperatures. That there is a certain mechanical rending
of these rocks, due to the “freezing” of salts within the capillary
fissures, has been already mentioned. A further strain
effect arises in rocks like granite, which are a mixture of different
minerals. Heated to a high temperature during the day and
cooled through a considerable range at night, the different minerals
alternately expand and contract at different rates and by different
relative amounts, so that strains are set up, tending to
tear them apart. The effect of these strains is thus a surface
crumbling of rocks.</p>

<p>But rock is, as already pointed out, a relatively poor conductor
of heat, and hence it is a relatively thin skin only which passes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
through the daily round of wide temperature range. This outer
shell when heated is expanded, and so tends to peel off, or exfoliate,
like the outer skin of an onion. The process is therefore
described as <i>exfoliation</i>. In all rocks of homogeneous texture the
continued action of this process results in convexly spherical surfaces,
the material scaled off in the process remaining as a slope
or talus which surrounds the projecting knob (<a href="#f210">Fig. 210</a>). Naked,
these projecting domes rise above the rim of débris at their bases.
Not a particle of dust adheres to the fresh rock surface&mdash;no
dirt interferes with its glaring whiteness. Yet close at hand lie
masses of débris into which wells may be carried to depths of
more than six hundred feet without encountering either solid
rock or ground water. The bare walls of granite sometimes mount
upwards for thousands of feet into the air, as steep and as inaccessible
as the squared towers of the Tyrolean Dolomites.</p>

</div></div>

<p>Rock is such a poor conductor of heat that special strains are
set up at the margin of sunlight and shade. This localization of
the disintegration on the margin of the shaded portions of rock
masses is known as <i>shadow weathering</i> (see <a href="#f215">Fig. 215</a>, <a href="#Page_206">p. 206</a>).</p>

<p>There is, however, still another mechanical disintegrating
process characteristic of the desert regions, which is likewise
dependent upon the sudden changes of temperature. Rains,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
though they may not occur for a year or more, come as sudden
downpours of great volume and violence. Rock masses, which
are highly heated beneath the desert sun, if suddenly dashed
with water, may be rent apart by the differential strains set up
near the surface. That rocks may be easily rent as a result of
sudden chilling is well known to our Northern farmers, who are
accustomed to rid themselves of objectionable bowlders by first
building a fire about them and then dashing water upon their
surface. Thus split into fragments, even the larger bowlders
may be handled and so removed from the farming land. The
natural process of rock rending by the occasional cloudburst may
be described as <i>diffission</i>. Blocks as much as twenty-five feet in
diameter have been observed
in the desert of western
Texas, soon after being
broken into several fragments
at the time of a downpour
of rain (<a href="#f211">Fig. 211</a>).</p>

<p><b>The natural sand blast.</b>&mdash;Because
of the saucer-like
shape, the vast expanse, and
the absence of wind breaks,
the potency of wind as a
geological agent is in desert
areas not easily overestimated.
While most of its work is accomplished with the aid of
tools, it has been proven that even without this help, considerable
work is done through the friction of the wind alone, particularly
when moving as powerful eddies in cracks and crannies. This
wear of the wind, unaided by cutting tools, is known as <i>deflation</i>.</p>

<p>The greater work of the wind is, however, accomplished with
the aid of larger or smaller rock particles, the sand and dust,
with which it is so generally charged above the deserts. Unprotected
by any mat of vegetation the materials of the desert
surface are easily lifted and are constantly migrating with the
wind. The finest dust is raised high into the air, and is carried
beyond the marginal barriers, but none of the sand or coarser
materials ever passes beyond the borders.</p>

</div></div>

<p>The efficiency of this sand as a cutting tool when carried by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
wind is directly proportioned to the size of the grain, since with
larger fragments a heavier blow is struck when carried at any
given velocity. These more effective grains are, however, not lifted
far above the ground, but advance with a squirming or hopping
motion, much as do the larger pebbles upon the bottom of a river
at the time of a spring freshet. To quote Professor Walther:
“Whoever has had the opportunity
to travel over a surface
of dune sand when a strong wind
is blowing has found it easy to
convince himself of the grinding
action of the wind. At such
times the ground becomes alive,
everywhere the sand is creeping
over the surface with snake-like
squirmings, and the eye quickly
tires of these writhing movements of the currents of sand and
cannot long endure the scene.”</p>

desert sand blast (after Chamberlin and
Salisbury).</p>
</div></div>

<p>A direct consequence of this restriction of the more effective
cutting tools to the layer of air just above the ground, is the
strong tendency to cut away all projecting masses near their
bases. The “mushroom rocks”, which are so characteristic of
desert landscapes, have been shaped in this manner (<a href="#f212">Fig. 212</a>).
Another product of the desert
sand blast is the so-called <i>Windkante</i>
(wind-edge) or <i>Dreikante</i>
(three-edge), a pebble which is
usually shaped in the form of
a pyramid (<a href="#f213">Fig. 213</a>).</p>

<p>Whenever a rock face, open
to direct attack by the drifting
sand, is constituted of parts
which have different hardness,
the blast of sand pecks away
at the softer places and leaves the harder ones in relief. Thus is
produced the well-known “stone lattice” of the desert (<a href="#f214">Fig. 214</a>).
Particularly upon the neck of the great Sphinx have the flying
sand grains, by removing the softer layers, brought the sedimentary
structures of the sandstone into strong relief.</p>

</div></div>

<p>When guided both by planes of sedimentation and planes of jointing,
forms of a very high degree of ornamentation are developed.
Some of the most remarkable forms are due to the protection afforded
to the sun-exposed surfaces by the shell of desert varnish.
In the shaded portions of projecting masses there is no such protection,
and here the sand blast insinuates itself into every crack
and cranny. In this it is aided
by shadow weathering due to
the differential strains set up at
the border of the expanded sun-heated
surface. As a result,
projecting rock masses are sometimes
etched away beneath and
give the effect of a squatting
animal. These forms, due to
shadow erosion, have also been
likened to projecting faucets.
(<a href="#f215">Fig. 215</a>).</p>

</div></div>

<p>Worn by its impact upon neighboring sand grains while in transport,
but much more as it is thrown against the ground or hard
rock surfaces, the wind-driven or <i>eolian</i> sand is at last worn into
smoothly rounded granules which approach the form of a sphere.
Compared to the surface
which sea sand
acquires by attrition,
this shaping process is
much the more efficient,
since in the
water the beach sand
is buoyed up and is
more effectively cushioned
against its neighboring
grains. The
grains of beach sand
when examined under
a microscope are found to be much more irregular in form and
usually display the original fracture surfaces only in part abraded.</p>

<p><b>The dust carried out of the desert.</b>&mdash;When, standing upon the
mountain wall that surrounds a desert, the traveler gazes out to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
windward over the great depression, his field of view is generally
obscured by the yellow haze of the dust clouds moving across
the margins. Upon the mountain
flanks and extending far outside
the borders, this cloud of dust
settles as a shrouding mantle of
impalpable yellow powder, which
is known as <i>loess</i>. These deposits
are continually deepening, and
have sometimes accumulated until
they are hundreds or even thousands
of feet in thickness. Before
reaching its final resting place the
dust of this deposit may have
settled many times, and has certainly
been in part redistributed
by the streams near the desert
margin. In it are the ingredients
which are necessary for the nourishment
of plants, and it constitutes the most important of natural
soils. Continually fed by new deposits from
the desert, and refertilized from below by a
natural process so soon as the upper layers
become impoverished, it requires no artificial
fertilization. Without artificial aids the loess
of northern China has been tilled for thousands
of years without any signs of exhaustion.</p>

</div></div>

<p>Though easily pulverized between the fingers,
loess is none the less characterized by a perfect
vertical jointing and stands on vertical faces
as does the solid rock (<a href="#f216">Fig. 216</a>), but it is absolutely
devoid of layers or bedding. Its capacity
of standing in vertical cliffs the loess owes
to a never failing content of lime carbonate
which acts as a cement, and to a peculiar porous
structure caused by capillary canals that run
vertically through the mass, branching like
rootlets and lined with carbonate of lime. This texture once
destroyed, loess resolves itself into a common sticky clay.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>

<p>By the feet of passing animals or by wheels of vehicles, the loess
is crushed, and a portion is lifted and carried away by the wind.
Thus in the course of time roadways sink deep into the mass as
steep-walled cañons (<a href="#f217">Fig. 217</a>). A portion of the now structureless
clay remaining upon the roadway is at the time of the rains
transformed into a thick mud which makes traveling all but
impossible, though before its structure has been destroyed the
loess is perfectly drained to the bottom of its deposits.</p>

<p>The particles which compose the loess are sharply angular
quartz fragments, so fine that all but a few grains can be rubbed
into the pores of the skin. Fine scales of mica, such as are easily
lifted by the wind, are disseminated uniformly throughout the
mass. The only inclosures which are arranged in layers consist
of irregularly shaped concretions of clay. These show a striking
resemblance to ginger roots and are called by the Chinese “stone
ginger”, though they are elsewhere more generally known by
their German name of <i>Loessmännchen</i>, or loess dolls. These
concretions are so disposed in the loess that their longer axes are
vertical, and they were evidently separated from the mass and
not deposited with it.</p>

<p><b>The wandering dunes.</b>&mdash;Over the broad expanse of the desert,
sand and dust, and occasionally gypsum from the saline deposits,
are ever migrating with the wind; on quiet days in the eddying
“sand devils”, but especially during the terrifying sand storms
such as in the windy season darken the air of northern China and
southern Manchuria. This drift of the sand is halted only when
an obstruction is encountered&mdash;a projecting rock, a bush, or a
bunch of grass, or again the buildings of a city or a town. The
manner in which the sand is arrested
by obstacles of different
kinds is of great interest and importance,
and is utilized in raising
defenses against its encroachments.
If the obstacle is unyielding but
allows some of the wind to pass
through it, no eddies are produced
and the sand is deposited both to
windward and to leeward of the
obstruction to form a fairly symmetrical
mound (<a href="#f218">Fig. 218 <i>a</i></a>). An
obstruction which yields to the
wind causes the sand to deposit
in a mound which is largely to
leeward of the obstruction (<a href="#f218">Fig. 218 <i>b</i></a>).
A solid wall, on the other
hand, by inducing eddies, is at
first protected from the sand and mounds deposit both to windward
and to leeward (<a href="#f218">Fig. 218 <i>c</i></a> and <a href="#f219">Fig. 219</a>).</p>

<p>Except when held up by an obstruction, the drifting sand travels
to leeward in slowly migrating mounds or ridges which are known
as <i>dunes</i>. Their motion is due to the wind lifting the sand from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
the windward side and carrying it over the crest, from where it
slides down the leeward slope and assumes a surface which is
the angle of repose of the material. In contrast with this the
windward slope is
notably gradual, being
shaped in conformity
to the wind
currents.</p>

<p>The dunes which
are raised upon seashores,
like those of
the desert, are constantly
migrating,
those upon the shores
of the North Sea at
the average rate of
about twenty feet per year. Relentlessly they advance, and despite
all attempts to halt them, have many times overwhelmed
the villages along the coast. Upon the great barrier beach known
as the <i>Kurische Nehrung</i>, on the southeastern shore of the Baltic
Sea, such a burial of villages has more than once occurred, but
as in the course of time further migration of the dune has proceeded,
the ruins of the buried villages have been exhumed by
this natural excavating process (<a href="#f220">Fig. 220</a>).</p>

<p><b>The forms of dunes.</b>&mdash;The forms assumed by dunes are dependent
to a very large extent upon the strength of the wind
and the available supply of sand. With small quantities of
sand and with moderate winds, sickle-shaped dunes known as
<i>barchans</i> (<a href="#f221">Fig. 221</a>) are formed, whose convex and flatter slopes
are toward the wind and whose steep concave leeward slopes are
maintained at the angle of repose. The barchan is shaped by the
wind going both over and around the dune, constantly removing
sand from the windward side and depositing it to leeward. With
larger supplies of sand and winds which are not too violent a
series of barchans is built up, and these are arranged transversely
to the wind direction (<a href="#f222">Fig. 222 <i>b</i></a>). If the winds are more violent,
the minor depressions in the crests of the dunes become wind
channels, and the sand is then trailed out along them until the
arrangement of the ridges is parallel to the wind (<a href="#f222">Fig. 222 <i>c</i></a>).
The surfaces of dunes are
generally marked by beautiful
ripples in the sand,
which, seen from a little
distance, may give the appearance
of watered silk
(<a href="#p7a">plate 7 A</a>).</p>

</div></div>


<p>Under normal conditions
dunes are not stationary
but continue to
wander with the prevailing
winds until they have
reached the outer edge of
the zone of vegetation
near the base of the foothills
at the margin of the desert. Here the grasses and other
desert plants arrest the first sand grains that reach them, and
they continue to grow higher as the sands accumulate. Some of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
the desert plants, like the yuccas, have so adapted themselves to
desert conditions that they may grow upward with the sand for
many feet and so keep their crowns above its surface.</p>


<p><b>The cloudburst in the desert.</b>&mdash;Such clouds as enter the
desert through its mountain ramparts, and those derived from
evaporation from the hot desert soil, usually precipitate their
moisture before passing out of the basin. Above the highly
heated floor the heavy rain clouds are unable to drop their burden.
The rain can sometimes be seen descending, but long
before it has reached the ground it has again passed into vapor,
and through repetition of this process the clouds become so charged
with moisture that when they encounter a mountain wall and
are thus forced to rise, there is a sudden downpour not equaled
in the humid regions. Desert rains are rare, but violent beyond
comparison. Often for a year or more there is no rainfall upon
the loose sand or porous clay, and the few plants which survive
must push their roots deep down until they have reached the
zone of ground water. When the clouds burst, each small cañon
or <i>wed</i> (pl. <i>wadi</i>) within the mountain wall is quickly occupied
by a swollen current which carries a thick paste of sediment and
drowns everything before it. Ere it has flowed a mile, it may
be that the water has disappeared entirely, leaving a layer of mud
and sand which rapidly dries out with the reappearance of the sun.</p>

</div></div>

<p>As the mountains upon seacoasts are generally rising with
reference to the neighboring sea bottom, so the mountains which
hem in the deserts are generally growing upward with reference
to the inclosed desert floor. The marginal dislocations which
separate the two are often in evidence at the foot of the steep
slope (<a href="#f223">Fig. 223</a>), and these may even appear as visible earthquake<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
faults to indicate that the uplift is more accelerated than
the deposition along the mountain front.</p>

</div></div>

<p><b>The zone of the dwindling river.</b>&mdash;The rapid uplift so generally
characteristic of desert margins gives to the torrential streams
which develop after each cloudburst
such an unusual velocity
that when they emerge from the
mountain valleys on to the desert
floor, the current is suddenly
checked and the burden of sediment
in large part deposited at
the mouth of the valley so as to
form a coarse delta deposit which
is described as a <i>dry delta</i> (<a href="#f224">Fig. 224</a>). Dependent upon its steepness
of slope, this delta is variously referred to as an <i>alluvial fan</i>
or <i>apron</i>, or as an <i>alluvial cone</i>. Over the conical slopes of the
delta surface the stream is broken up into numerous distributaries
which divide and subdivide as do the roots of a tree. In the
Mohammedan countries described as <i>wadi</i>, these distributaries
upon dry deltas are on the Pacific coast of the United States
referred to as “washes” (<a href="#f225">Fig. 225</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div></div>

<p>Fast losing their velocity after emerging from the mountains,
the various distributaries drop first of all the heavy bowlders,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
then the large pebbles and the sand, so that only the finer sand
and the silt are carried to the margin of the delta. As they
enlarge their boundaries, the neighboring deltas eventually
coalesce and so form an <i>alluvial bench</i> or “gravel piedmont” at
the foot of the range. Only the larger streams are able to entirely
cross this bench of parched deposits with its coarsely porous
structure, for the water is soon sucked up by the thirsty materials.
Encountering in its descent more clayey layers, this water
is conducted to the surface near the margin of the bench and
may there appear as a line of springs. At this level there develops,
therefore, a zone of vegetation, though there is no local rain.</p>

<p>The alluvial bench grows upward by accretion of layers which
are thickest at the mountain end, so that the steepness of the
bench increases with time.</p>


<p><b>Erosion in and about the desert.</b>&mdash;The violent cloudburst that
is characteristic of the arid lands is a most potent agent in modeling
the surface of the ground wherever the rock materials are
not too firmly coherent. Under the dash of the rain a peculiar
type of “bad land” topography is developed (<a href="#p5b">plate 5 B</a> and <a href="#f226">Fig. 226</a>).
Such a rain-cut surface is a veritable maze
of alternating gully and ridge, a country
worthless for agricultural purposes and offering
the greatest difficulty in the way of penetrating
it. When composed of stiff clay with
scattered pebbles and bowlders, the effect of
the “rain erosion” is to fashion steep clay
pillars each capped by a pebble and described
as “demoiselles” (<a href="#f226">Fig. 226</a>).</p>

<div class="floatleft">

“demoiselles” in the
“bad lands” (after a
photograph by Fairbanks).</p>
</div></div>

<p>Behind the mountain front the valleys out
of which the torrents are discharged are usually
short with steep side walls and a relatively
flat bottom, ending headward in an
amphitheater with precipitous walls (<a href="#f227">Fig. 227</a>).
In the western United States such
valleys are referred to as “box cañons”, but
in Mohammedan countries the name “wed” applies to the river
valley within the mountains and to the distributaries as well.</p>


<p><b>Characteristic features of the arid lands.</b>&mdash;It is characteristic
of erosion and deposition within humid regions that all outlines<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
become softened into flowing curves, due to the protective mat
of vegetation. In arid lands those massive rocks which are
without structural planes of separation, partly as a consequence
of exfoliation, develop broad domes which are projected upon
the horizon as great semicircles,
broken in half it may be by
displacement. The same massive
rocks where intersected by vertical
joint planes yield, on the contrary,
sharp granite needles like those of
Harney Peak (plate 8 A). Similarly,
schistose or bedded rocks, when tilted
at a high angle, may yield forms
which are almost identical. Examples
of such needles are found in
the Garden of the Gods in Colorado.</p>

<p>At lower levels, where the flying
sand becomes effective as an eroding
agent, flat bedded rocks become
etched into shelves and cornices, and
if intersected by joints, the shelves
and cornices are transformed into groups of castellated towers and
pinnacles of a high degree of ornamentation. These fantastic
erosion remnants are usually referred to as “chimneys” and may
be seen in numbers in the bad lands of Dakota, as they may in
Colorado either in Monument Park or in the new Monolithic
National Park (plate 8 B).</p>

</div></div>

<p>Where wind erosion plays a smaller rôle in the sculpture, but
where after an uplift a river has made its way, horizontally bedded
rocks are apt to be carved into broad <i>rock terraces</i>, nowhere shown
upon so grand a scale as about the Grand Cañon of the Colorado.
Each harder layer has here produced a floor or terrace which
ends in a vertical escarpment, and this is separated from the
next lower layer of more resistant rock by a slope of talus which
largely hides the softer intermediate beds. The great Desert of
Sahara is shaped in a series of rock terraces or steppes which
descend toward the interior of the basin.</p>

<p>A single harder layer of resistant rock comes often to form
the flat capping of a plateau, and is then known as a <i>mesa</i>, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
table mountain. Along its front, detached outliers usually stand
like sentinels before the larger mass, and according to their relative
proportions, these are referred to either as small mesas or
as the smaller <i>buttes</i> (<a href="#f228">Fig. 228</a>).</p>

<p><b>The war of dune and oasis.</b>&mdash;In every desert the deposits
are arranged in consecutive belts or zones which are alternately
the work of wind and water. Surrounding the desert and upon
the flanks of the mountain wall there is found (1) the deposit of
loess derived from the dust that is carried out of the desert by
the wind. Immediately within the desert border at the base of
the mountains is (2) the zone of the dwindling river with its
sloping bench of coarse rubble and gravel.</p>

<p>Next in order is
(3) the belt of the flying sand, a zone of dune ridges often separated
by narrow, flat-bottomed basins (<a href="#f229">Fig. 229</a>) into which the
strongest streams bring the finer sands and silt from the mountains.
Lastly, there is (4) the central sink or sinks, into which
all water not at once absorbed within the zone of alluviation or
in the zone of dunes is finally collected. Here are the true lacustrine
deposits of clay and separated salts (<a href="#f230">Fig. 230</a> and <a href="#f207">Fig. 207</a>,
<a href="#Page_201">p. 201</a>). The lake deposits fill in all the original irregularities
of the desert floor, out of which the tops of isolated ranges of
mountains now project like islands out of the surface of the sea.

in their order from
the margin to the center

<p>The zone of vegetation,
as already stated, lies near
the foot of the alluvial
bench, so that here are
found the oases about
which have clustered the
cities of the desert from
the earliest records of antiquity until now. Just without the line
of oases is the wall of dunes held back from further advance only
by the vegetation which in turn is dependent upon the rains in
the neighboring mountains. With every diminution in the water
supply, the dunes advance and encroach upon the oases (<a href="#p7b">plate 7 B</a>);
while with every considerable increase in this supply of moisture
the alluvial bench advances over the dunes and acquires a strip
of their territory. Thus with varying fortunes a war is continually
waged between the withering river and the flying sand,
and the alternations of climate are later recorded in the dovetailing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>

<p>In addition to the smaller periodic alternations of pluvial and
interpluvial climate&mdash;the
“pulse of Asia”&mdash;the
record of the Asiatic
deserts indicates a progressive
desiccation of
the entire region, which
has now given the victory
to the dune. The
ancient history of the
cities of the plains supplies
the records of many
that have been buried
in the dunes. To-day,
where once were prosperous
cities, nothing is
to be seen at the surface but a group of mounds (<a href="#f232">Fig. 232</a>). Exhumed
after much painstaking labor, the walls and palaces of
these ancient cities
have once more been
brought to the light
of day, and much
has thus been
learned of the civilization
of these
early times (<a href="#f233">Fig. 233</a>).
Quite recently
the mounds
which cover between
one and two
hundred buried villages
have been
found upon the borders
of the Tarim
basin of central Asia, where they were lost to history when
they were overwhelmed in the early centuries of the Christian
Era.</p>

<p><b>The origin of the high plains which front
the Rocky Mountains.</b>&mdash;To the eastward of
the great backbone of the North American
continent stretches a vast plain gently inclined
away from the range and generally
known as the High Plains region (plate 9).
The tourist who travels westward by train
ascends this slope so gradually that when he
has reached the mountain front it is difficult
to realize that he has climbed to an altitude
of five thousand feet above the level of the
sea. That he has also passed through several
climatic zones&mdash;a humid, a semiarid, and
an arid&mdash;and has now entered a semiarid
district, is more easily appreciated from study
of the vegetation (<a href="#f234">Fig. 234</a>). The surface of
the High Plains, where not cut into by rivers,
is remarkably even, so that it might be compared
to the quiet surface of a great lake.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div></div>

<p>The materials which compose the surface
veneer of these plains are coarse conglomerates,
gravels, and sands, and the so-called
“mortar beds”, which are nothing but sands
cemented into sandstone by carbonate of lime.
The pebbles in all these deposits are far-traveled
and appear to have been derived
from erosion of those crystalline rocks which
compose the eastern front of the Rocky
Mountains. These different materials are
not arranged in strictly parallel beds, as are
the deposits of a lake or sea; but the beds
are made up of long threads of lenticular
cross section which are interlaced in the most
intricate fashion and which extend down the
slope, or outward from the mountain front
(<a href="#f235">Fig. 235</a>). It is thus shown that the High
Plains are a bench or plain of alluviation
formed at the front of the Rocky Mountains
during an earlier series of pluvial periods, and that subsequent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
uplift has produced the modern river valleys which are cut out of
the plain. The plexus of long threads of the coarser materials are
the courses of dwindling rivers which interlaced over the former
plain, and which in time were buried under other channel deposits
of the same nature but in different positions (<a href="#f236">Fig. 236</a>). The
pluvial periods in which this
bench was formed produced
in other latitudes the great
continental glaciers which
wrought such marvelous
changes in northern North

<p><b>Character profiles.</b>&mdash;In
contrast with the profiles in the landscapes of humid regions (see
<a href="#f187">Fig. 187</a>, <a href="#Page_177">p. 177</a>), those of arid lands are marked by straighter
elements (<a href="#f237">Fig. 237</a>). Almost the only exception of importance is
furnished by the domes of massive granite monoliths, which are
sometimes broken in half by great displacements. Below the
horizon the secondary lines in the landscape betray the same
straightness of the component elements by the gabled slopes
of talus which are many times repeated so as almost to reproduce
the lines in a house of cards, since the sloping lines are
maintained at the angle of repose of the materials (<a href="#f482">Fig. 482</a>, <a href="#Page_443">p. 443</a>).
Wherever the waves of desert lakes have made an attack upon the
rocks and have retired the projecting spurs, other gables characterized
by slightly different slopes are introduced into the landscape.</p>

<h2 class="pc4">CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<p class="pch">REPEATING PATTERNS IN THE EARTH RELIEF</p>

<p><b>The weathering processes under control of the fracture system.</b>&mdash;In
an earlier chapter it was learned that the rocks which compose
the earth’s surface shell are intersected by a system of
joint fractures which in little-disturbed areas divide the surface
beds into nearly square perpendicular prisms (<a href="#f36">Fig. 36</a>, <a href="#Page_55">p. 55</a>),
more or less modified by additional diagonal joints, and often
also by more disorderly fractures. Throughout large areas these
fractures may maintain nearly constant directions, though either
one or more of the master series may be locally absent. This
distinctive architecture of the surface shell of the lithosphere has
exercised its influence upon the various weathering processes, as it
has also upon the activities of running water and of other less
common transporting agencies at the surface.</p>

<p>Within high latitudes, where frost action is the dominant
weathering process, the water, by insinuating itself along the
joints and through repeated freezings, has broken down the rock
in the immediate neighborhood of these fractures, and so has
impressed upon the surface an image of the underlying pattern
of structure lines (<a href="#p10a">plate 10 A</a>).</p>

<p>In much lower latitudes and in regions of insufficient rainfall,
the same structures are impressed upon the relief, but by other
weathering processes. In the case of the less coherent deposits
in these provinces, the initial forms of their erosional surface have
sometimes been determined by the dash of rain from the sudden
cloudburst. Thus the “bad lands” may have their initial gullies
directed and spaced in conformity with the underlying joint structures
(<a href="#f238">Fig. 238</a>).</p>

</div></div>

<p>In such portions of the temperate regions as are favored by a
humid climate, the mat of vegetation holds down a layer of soil,
and mat and soil in coöperation are effective in preventing any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
such large measure of frostwork as is characteristic of the subpolar
regions or of high levels in the arid lands. In humid regions
the rocks become a prey especially
to the processes of solution
and accompanying chemical
decomposition, and these
processes, although guided by
the course of the percolating
ground water along the fracture
planes, do not afford such
striking examples of the control
of surface relief.</p>

<p>Those limestones which
slowly pass into solution in
the percolating water do, however,
quite generally indicate
a localization of the solution
along the joint channels (<a href="#f239">Fig. 239</a> and <a href="#p6b">plate 6 B</a>).
Though in other rocks not so apparent,
yet solutions generally take
their courses along the same channels, and upon them is localized
the development of the newly formed hydrated and carbonate
minerals, as is well illustrated by
the phenomenon of spheroidal
weathering (<a href="#f155">Fig. 155</a>, <a href="#Page_150">p. 150</a>).</p>

<p><b>The fracture control of the drainage
lines.</b>&mdash;The etching out of
the earth’s architectural plan in
the surface relief, which we have
seen begun in the processes of
weathering, is continued after the
transporting agents have become
effective. It is often easy to see
that a river has taken its course
in rectangular zigzags like the
elbows of a jointed stove pipe, and that its walls are formed
of joint planes from which an occasional squared buttress projects
into the channel. This structure is rendered in the plan of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
the Abisko Cañon of northern Lapland (<a href="#f240">Fig. 240</a>). We are later
to learn that another great transporting agent, the water wave,
makes a selective attack upon the lithosphere
along the fractures of the joint
system (<a href="#f250">Fig. 250</a>, <a href="#Page_233">p. 233</a> and <a href="#f254">Fig. 254</a>,
<a href="#Page_235">p. 235</a>).</p>

<div class="floatright">

joint-controlled Abisko
Cañon in northern Lapland

</div></div>

<p>Where the scale of the example is large,
as in the cases which have been above
cited, the actual position and directions
of the joint wall are easily compared with
the near-by elements of the river’s course,
so that the connection of the drainage
lines with the underlying structure is at
once apparent. In many examples where
the scale is small, the evidence for the controlling
influence of the rock structure in
determining the courses of streams may
be found in the peculiar character of the drainage plan. To
illustrate: the course of the Zambesi River, within the gorge below
the famous Victoria Falls, not only makes repeated turnings at a
right angle, but its tributary streams, instead of making the usual
sharp angle where they join the
main stream, also affect the right
angle in their junctions (<a href="#f241">Fig. 241</a>).</p>

Zambesi River below the Victoria
Falls (after Lamplugh).</p>
</div></div>

<p><b>The repeating pattern in drainage
networks.</b>&mdash;It is a characteristic of
the joint system that the fractures
within each series are spaced with
approximation to uniformity. If
the plan of a drainage system has
been regulated in conformity with
the architecture of the underlying
rock basement, the same repeating
rectangles of the master joints may
be expected to appear in the lines of drainage&mdash;the so-called
drainage network.</p>

<p>Such rectangular patterns do very generally appear in the
drainage network, though they are often masked upon modern
maps by what, to the geologist, seems impertinent intrusion of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
black lines of overprinting which indicate railways, lines of highway,
and other culture elements. On river maps, which are
printed without culture, the pattern is much more easily recognized
(<a href="#f242">Figs. 242</a> and <a href="#f243">243</a>). Wherever the relief is strong, as is
the case in the Adirondack Mountain province of the State of
New York, individual hills may stand in relief between the bounding
streams which compose the rectangular network, like the
squared pedestals of monuments. Such a type of relief carved in
repeating patterns has been described as “checkerboard topography.”</p>

<p class="vh">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><b>The dividing lines of the relief patterns&mdash;lineaments.</b>&mdash;The
repeating design outlined in the river network of the Temiskaming
district (<a href="#f243">Fig. 243</a>) would appear in greater perfection if we
could reproduce the relief without at the same time obscuring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
the lines of drainage; for where the pattern is not completely
closed by the course of the stream, there is generally found either
a dry valley or a ravine to complete the design. If these are
not present, a bit of straight coast line, a visible line of fracture,
a zone of fault breccia, or the boundary line separating
different formations may one or more of them fill in the gaps of
the parallel straight drainage lines which by their intersection
bring out the pattern. These significant lines of landscapes
which reveal the hidden architecture of the rock basement are
described as <i>lineaments</i> (<a href="#f82">Fig. 82</a>, <a href="#Page_87">p. 87</a>). They are the character
lines of the earth’s physiognomy.</p>

<p>It is important to emphasize the essentially composite expression
of the lineament. At one locality it appears as a drainage
line, a little farther on it may be a line of coast; then, again,
it is a series of aligned waterfalls, a visible fault trace, or a rectilinear
boundary between formations; but in every case it is some
surface expression of a buried fracture. Hidden as they so generally
are, the fracture lines must be searched out by every means
at our disposal, if we are not to be misled in accounting for the
positions and the attitudes of disturbed rock masses.</p>

<p>As we have learned, during earthquake shocks, as at no other
time, the surface of the earth is so sensitized as to betray the
position of its buried fractures. As the boundaries of orographic
blocks, certain of the fractures are at such times the seats of
especially heavy vibrations; they are the seismotectonic lines
of the earthquake province. Many lineaments are identical
with seismotectonic lines, and they therefore afford a means of
to some extent determining in advance the lines of greatest danger
from earthquake shock.</p>


<p><b>The composite repeating patterns of the higher orders.</b>&mdash;Not
only do the larger joint blocks become impressed upon the earth
relief as repeating diaper patterns, but larger and still larger composite
units of the same type may, in favorable districts, be found
to present the same characters. Attention has already been
more than once directed to the fact that the more perfect and
prominent fracture planes recur among the joints of any series at
more or less regular intervals (<a href="#f40">Fig. 40</a>, <a href="#Page_57">p. 57</a>, and <a href="#f41">Fig. 41</a>, <a href="#Page_58">p. 58</a>).
Nowhere, perhaps, is this larger order of the repeating pattern
more perfectly exemplified than in some recent deposits in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
Syrian desert (<a href="#p10b">plate 10 B</a>). It is usually, however, in the older
sediments that such structures may be recognized; as, for example,
in the squared towers and buttresses of the Tyrolean
Dolomites (<a href="#f244">Fig. 244</a>). Here the larger blocks appear in the thick
bedded lower formation, the dolomite, divided into subordinate
sections of large dimensions; but in the overlying formations
in blocks of relatively small size, yet with similarly perfect subequal
spacing.</p>

<p>The observing traveler who is privileged to make the journey
by steamer, threading its course in and out among the many islands
and skerries of the Norwegian coast, will hardly fail to be
struck by the remarkable profiles of most of the lower islands
(<a href="#f245">Fig. 245</a>). These profiles are generally convexly scalloped with a
noteworthy regularity, and not in one unit only, but in at least two
with one a multiple of the other (<a href="#f246">Fig. 246</a>). As the steamer passes
near to the islands, it is discovered that the smaller recognizable
units in the island profiles are separated by widely gaping joints
which do not, however, belong to the unit series, but to a larger
composite group (<a href="#f246">Fig. 246 <i>b</i></a>). Frostwork, which depends for its
action upon open spaces within the rocks, has here been the cause
of the excessive weathering above the more widely gaping joints.</p>

<p>High northern latitudes are thus especially favorable for revealing
all the details in the architectural pattern of the lithosphere
shell, and we need not be surprised that when the modern
maps of the Norwegian coast are examined, still larger repeating
patterns than any
that may be seen
in the field are to
be made out. The
Norwegian coast
was long ago shown
to be a complexly
faulted region, and
these larger divisions
of the relief
pattern, instead of being explained as a consequence solely of
selective weathering, must be regarded as due largely to fault
displacements of the type represented in our model (<a href="#p4c">plate 4 C</a>).
Yet whether due to displacements or to the more numerous
joints, all belong to the same composite system of fractures
expressed in the relief.</p>

<p class="pch">THE FORMS CARVED AND MOLDED BY WAVES</p>

<p><b>The motion of a water wave.</b>&mdash;The motions within a wave
upon the surface of a body of water may be thought of in two
different ways. First of all, there is the motion of each particle
of water within an orbit of its own; and there is, further, the forward
motion of propagation of the wave considered as a whole.</p>

<div class="floatright">

     <div class="cf"><p class="pc250"><span class="smcap">Fig. 247.</span>&mdash;Diagram to show the nature of the
motions within a free water wave.</p>
</div></div>

<p>The water particle in a wave has a continued motion round and
round its orbit like that of a horse circling a race course, only that
here the track is in a
vertical plane, directed
along the line of propagation
of the wave (<a href="#f247">Fig. 247</a>).
Each particle of
water, through its friction
upon neighboring
particles, is able to
transmit its motion both
along the surface and
downward into the water
below. The force which
starts the water in motion
and develops the
wave, is the friction of
wind blowing over the
water surface, and the size of the orbit of the water particle at
any point is proportional to the wind’s force and to the stretch of
water over which it has blown. The wind’s effect is, therefore,
cumulative&mdash;the wave is proportional to the wind’s effect upon
all water particles in its rear, added to the local wind friction.</p>

<p>The size or <i>height</i> of the wave is measured by the diameter of the
orbit of motion of the surface particle, and this is the difference
in height between trough and crest. The distance from crest
to crest, or from trough to trough, is called the <i>wave length</i>.
Though the wave motion is transmitted downward into the water<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
there is a continued loss of energy which is here not compensated
by added wind friction, and so the orbital motion grows smaller and
smaller, until at the depth of about a wave length it has completely
died out. This level of no motion is called the <i>wave base</i>. In
quiet weather the level of no motion is practically at the water’s
surface, and inasmuch as the geological work of waves is in large
part accomplished during the great storms, the term “wave base”
refers to the lowest level of wave motion at the time of the heaviest
storms. Upon the ocean the highest waves that have been
measured have an amplitude of about fifty feet and a wave
length of about six hundred feet.</p>


<p><b>Free waves and breakers.</b>&mdash;So long as the depth of the water
is below wave base, there is obviously no possibility of interference
with the wave through friction upon the bottom. Under
these conditions waves are described as <i>free waves</i>, and their forms
are symmetrical except in so far as their crests are pulled over
and more or less dissipated in the spray of the “white caps” at
the time of high winds.</p>

as it approaches the shore.</p>
</div></div>

<p>As a wave approaches a shore, which generally has a gentle
outward sloping surface, there is interposed in the way of a free
forward movement the friction upon the bottom. This friction
begins when the depth of water is less than wave base, and its
effect is to hold back the wave at the bottom. Carried slowly
upward in the water by the friction of particle upon particle,
the effect of this holding back is a piling up of the water, which increases
the wave height as it diminishes the wave length, and also
interferes with wave symmetry (<a href="#f248">Fig. 248</a>). Moving forward
at the top under its inertia of motion and held back at the bottom
by constantly increasing friction, a strong turning motion or
couple is started about a horizontal axis, the immediate effect
of which is to steepen the forward slope of the wave, and this continues
until it overhangs,
and, falling, “breaks” into
surf. Such a breaking
wave is called a “comber”
or “breaker” (<a href="#p11b">plate 11 B</a>).</p>

<p><b>Effect of the breaking
wave upon a steep rocky
shore&mdash;the notched cliff.</b>&mdash;If
the shore rises abruptly
from deeper water, the top
of the breaking wave is
hurled against the cliff with
the force of a battering ram.
During storms the water of
shore waves is charged with sand, and each sand particle is driven
like a stone cutter’s tool under the stroke of his hammer. The effect
is thus both to chip and to batter away the rock of the shore to
the height reached by the wave, undermining it and notching
the rock at its base (<a href="#f249">Fig. 249</a>). When the notch has been cut
in this manner to a sufficient depth, the overhanging rock falls
by its own weight in blocks which
are bounded by the ever present
joints, leaving the upper cliff face
essentially vertical.</p>

</div></div>

<p><b>Coves, sea arches, and stacks.</b>&mdash;It
is the headland which is
most exposed to the work of the
waves, since with change of wind
direction it is exposed upon more
than a single face. The study of
headlands which have been cut
by waves shows that the joints
within the rock play a large rôle
in the shaping of shore features.
The attack of the waves under
the direction of these planes of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
ready separation opens out indentations of the shore (<a href="#f250">Fig. 250</a>) or
forms <i>sea caves</i> which, as they extend to the top of the cliff by the
process of sapping, yield the <i>coves</i> which are so common a feature
upon our rock-bound shores
(<a href="#f259">Fig. 259</a>, <a href="#Page_238">p. 238</a>). With continuation
of this process, the caves
formed on opposite sides of the
headland may be united to form
a <i>sea arch</i> (<a href="#f251">Fig. 251</a>).</p>

<div class="floatleft">

Grand Arch upon one of the Apostle
Islands in Lake Superior (after a photograph
by the Detroit Photographic
Company).</p>
</div></div>

<p>A later stage in this selective
wave carving under the control
of joints is reached when the
bridge above the arch has
fallen in, leaving a detached
rock island with precipitous
walls. Such an offshore island
of rock with precipitous sides
is known as a <i>stack</i> (<a href="#f252">Fig. 252</a>),
or sometimes as a
“chimney”, though this latter
term is best restricted to other and similar forms which are the
product of selective weathering (<a href="#Page_300">p. 300</a>).</p>

Superior.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Whenever the rock is less firmly consolidated, and so does not
stand upon such steep planes,
the stack is apt to have a
more conical form, and may
not be preceded in its formation
by the development of
the sea arch (<a href="#f260">Fig. 260</a>, <a href="#Page_239">p. 239</a>).
In the reverse case, or where
the rock possesses an unusual
tenacity, the stack may be
largely undermined and stand
supported like a table upon
thick legs or pillars of rock
(<a href="#f253">Fig. 253</a>). In <a href="#f254">Fig. 254</a> is
seen a group of stacks upon the coast of California, which show
with clearness the control of the joints in their formation, but
unlike the marble of the South American example the forms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
are not rounded, but retain
their sharp angles.</p>

<p><b>The cut rock terrace.</b>&mdash;When
waves first begin their
attack upon a steep, rocky
shore, the lower limit of the
action is near the wave base.
The action at this depth is,
however, less efficient, and as
the recession of the cliff is one
of the most rapid of erosional
processes, the rock floor outside the receding cliff comes to slope
gradually downward from the cliff to a maximum depth at the
edge of the terrace, approximately equal to wave base (<a href="#f255">Fig. 255</a>).
This cut terrace is extended seaward or lakeward, as the case may
be, in a <i>built terrace</i> constructed from a portion of the rock débris
acquired from the cliff.</p>

</div></div>

<p>The broken wave, after rising upon the terrace under the inertia
of its motion until all its energy has been dissipated, slides outward
by gravity, and though
checked and overridden by
succeeding breakers, it continues
its outward slide as
the “undertow” until it
reaches the end of the terrace.
Here it suddenly enters
deep water, and losing
its velocity, drops its burden
of rock, and builds the terrace
seaward after the manner
of construction of an
embankment. As we are to see, the larger portion of the wave-quarried
material is diverted to a different quarter.</p>

</div></div>

<p>To gain some conception of the importance of wave cutting
as an eroding process, we may consider the late history of Heligoland,
a sandstone island off the mouth of the Elbe in the North
Sea (<a href="#f256">Fig. 256</a>). From a periphery of 120 miles, which it possessed
in the ninth century
of the Christian
era, the
island has reduced
its outline to 45
miles in the fourteenth
century, 8
miles in the seventeenth,
and to
about 3 miles at
the beginning of
the twentieth century.
The German
government, which
recently acquired
this little remnant
from England, has
expended large
sums of money in an effort to save this last relic.</p>

</div></div>

<p><b>The cut and built terrace on a steep shore of loose materials.</b>&mdash;In
materials which lack the coherence of firm rock, no vertical
cliff can form; for as fast as undermined by the waves the loose
materials slide down
and assume a surface
of practically constant
slope&mdash;the “angle of
repose” of the materials
(<a href="#f257">Fig. 257</a>). The
terrace below this
sloping cliff will not
differ in shape from
that cut upon a rocky shore; but whenever the materials of the
shore include disseminated blocks too large for the waves to handle,
they collect upon the terrace near where they have been exhumed,
thus forming what has been called a “bowlder pavement” (<a href="#f258">Fig. 258</a>).</p>

<div class="floatleft">
     <img src="images/ill-296b.jpg" width="250" height="235" id="f258"

</div></div>

<p>The edge of the cut and built terrace is, as already mentioned,
maintained at the depth of wave base. If one will study the submerged
contours of any of our
inland lakes, it will be found
that these basins are surrounded
by a gently sloping
marginal shelf,&mdash;the cut and
built terrace,&mdash;and that the
depth of this shelf at its outer
edge is proportioned to the
size of the lake. Upon Lake
Mendota at Madison, Wisconsin,
the large storm waves have
a length of about twenty feet,
which is the depth of the outer
edge of the shore terraces (<a href="#f267">Fig. 267</a>, <a href="#Page_242">p. 242</a>). The shelf surrounding
the continents has,
with few local exceptions, a uniform depth of 100 fathoms, or about
the wave base of the heaviest storm waves.</p>


<p><b>The work of the shore current.</b>&mdash;In describing the formation
of the built terrace, it was stated that the greater part of the rock<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
material quarried upon headlands by the waves is diverted from
the offshore terrace. This diversion is the work of the shore current
produced by the wave.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

molded by it.</p>
</div></div>

<p>At but few places upon a shore will the storm waves beat perpendicularly,
and then for but short periods only. The broken
wave, as it crawls ever more slowly up the beach, carries the sand
with it in a sweeping curve, and by the time gravity has put a stop
to its forward movement, it is directed for a brief instant parallel
to the shore. Soon, however, the pull of gravity upon it has started
the backward journey in a more direct course down the slope of
the terrace; and here encountering the next succeeding breaker,
a portion of the water and the coarser sand particles with it are
again carried forward for a repetition of the zigzag journey. This
many times interrupted movement of the sand particles may be
observed during a high wind upon any sandy lee shore. The “set”
of the water along the shore as a result of its zigzag journeyings
is described as the <i>shore current</i> (<a href="#f259">Fig. 259</a>), and the effect upon
sand distribution is the same as though a steady current moved
parallel to the shore in the direction of the average trend of the
moving particles.</p>

<p><b>The sand beach.</b>&mdash;The first effect of the shore current is to
deposit some portion of the sand within the first slight recess upon
the shore in the lee of the cliff. The earlier deposits near the cliff<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
gradually force the shore current farther from the shore and
so lay down a sand selvage to the shore, which is shaped in the
form of an arc or crescent and known as a <i>beach</i> (<a href="#f259">Fig. 259</a> and
<a href="#f260">Fig. 260</a>).</p>

<p><b>The shingle beach.</b>&mdash;With heavy storms and an exceptional
reach of the waves, the shore currents are competent to move, not
the sand alone, but pebbles, the area of whose broader surface may
be as great as the palm of one’s hand. Such rock fragments are
shaped by the continued wear against their neighbors under the
restless breakers, until they have a lenticular
or watch-shaped form (<a href="#f261">Fig. 261</a>).
Such beach pebbles are described as <i>shingle</i>,
and they are usually built up into distinct
ridges upon the shore, which, under the
fury of the high breakers, may be piled several feet above the level
of quiet water (<a href="#f262">Fig. 262</a>). Such storm beaches have a gentle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
forward slope graded by the shore current, but a steep backward
slope on the angle of repose. Most storm beaches have
been largely shaped by the last great storm, such as comes only
at intervals of a number of years.</p>

<p><b>Bar, spit, and barrier.</b>&mdash;Wherever
the shore upon which
a beach is building makes a
sudden landward turn at the entrance
to a bay, the shore currents,
by virtue of their inertia
of motion, are unable longer to
follow the shore. The débris
which they carry is thus transported
into deeper water in a
direction corresponding to a continuation
of the shore just before
the point of turning (see <a href="#f259">Fig. 259</a>, <a href="#Page_238">p. 238</a>). The result is the
formation of a <i>bar</i>, which rises to near the water surface and is extended
across the entrance to the bay through continued growth
at its end, after the manner of constructing a railway embankment
across a valley.</p>

<div class="floatright">

</div></div>

<p>Over the deeper water near the bar the waves are at first not
generally halted and broken, as they are upon the shore, and so
the bar does not at once
build itself to the surface,
but remains an invisible
bar to navigation. From
its shoreward end, however,
the waves of even
moderate storms are
broken, and the bar is
there built above the water
surface, where it appears
as a narrow cape of sand
or shingle which gradually
thins in approaching its
apex. This feature is the well-known <i>spit</i> (<a href="#f263">Fig. 263</a>) which, as it
grows across the entrance to the bay, becomes a <i>barrier</i> or <i>barrier
beach</i> (<a href="#f264">Fig. 264</a>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p>

<p>The continuation of the visible in the usually invisible bar, is
at the time of high winds made strikingly apparent, for the wave
base is below the crest of the bar, and at such times its crescentic

</div></div>

<p>The construction of a barrier across the entrance to a bay transforms
the latter into a separate body of water, a lagoon, within
which silting up and peat
formation usually lead to an
early extinction (<a href="#Page_429">p. 429</a>). The
formation of barriers thus
tends to straighten out the
irregularities of coast lines,
and opens the way to a
natural enlargement of the
land areas. While the coasts
of the United Kingdom of
Great Britain have been
losing some four thousand
acres through wave erosion,
there has been a gain by
growth in quiet lagoons which
amounts to nearly seven
times that amount. As evidence of the straightening of the shore
line which results from this process, the coast of the Carolinas or
of Nantucket (<a href="#f459">Fig. 459</a>) may serve for illustration.</p>

<p><b>The land-tied island.</b>&mdash;We have seen that wave erosion operates
to separate small islands from the headlands, but the shore
currents counteract this loss to the continents by throwing out
barriers which join many separated islands to the mainland. Such
land-tied islands are a common feature on many rocky coasts,
and upon the New England coast they usually have been given the
name of “neck.” The long arc of Lynn Beach joins the former
island of Nahant, through its smaller neighbor Little Nahant,
to the coast of Massachusetts. A similar land-tied island is
Marblehead Neck. The Rock of Gibraltar, formerly an island,
is now joined to Spain by the low beach known as the “neutral
ground.” The Spanish name, <i>tombola</i>, has sometimes been employed
to describe an island thus connected to the shore.</p>

wedge of shore deposits which

raises the level of the
lake bottom (<a href="#f266">Fig. 266</a>), and when coast irregularities are favorable
to it, new spits will develop upon the shore outside the
earlier one, and a new bar, and in its turn a barrier, will be found
outside the initial one, taking a course in a direction more or less
parallel to it (<a href="#f267">Fig. 267</a>).</p>

only, the sloping

<p class="pch">COAST RECORDS OF THE RISE OR FALL OF THE
LAND</p>

<p><b>The characters in which the record has been preserved.</b>&mdash;The
peculiar forms into which the sea has etched and molded its
shores have been considered in the last chapter. Of these the
more significant are the notched rock cliff, the cut rock terrace,
the sea cave, the sea arch, the stack, and the sloping cliff and terrace,
among the carved features; and the barrier beach and built
terrace, among the molded forms. It is important to remember
that the molded forms, by the very manner of their formation,
stand in a definite relationship to the carved features; so that
when either one has been in part effaced and made difficult of determination,
the discovery of the other in its correct natural position
may remove all doubt as to the origin of the relic.</p>

coast of Florida, with

coast.</p>
</div></div>

<p>In studies of the change of level of the land, it is customary to
refer all variations to the sea level as a zero plane of reference.
It is not on this account necessary to assume that the changes
measured from this arbitrary datum plane are the absolute upward
or downward oscillations which would be measured from the
earth’s center; for the sea, like the land, has been subject to its
changes of level. There need, however, be no apology for the
use of the sea surface as a plane of reference; for it is all that we
have available for the purpose, and the changes in level, even if
relative only, are of the greatest significance. It is probable that
in most cases where the coast line is rising from uplift, some portion
of the sea basin not far distant is becoming deepened, so that
the visible change of level is the algebraic sum of the two effects.</p>

<p><b>Even coast line the mark of uplift.</b>&mdash;It was early pointed out
in this volume (<a href="#Page_158">p. 158</a>) that the floor of the sea in the neighborhood
of the land presents a relatively even surface. The carving by
waves, combined with the process of deposition of sediments, tends
to fill up the minor irregularities of surface and preserve only the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
features of larger scale, and these in much softened outlines. Upon
the continents, on the contrary, the running water, taking advantage
of every slight difference in elevation and
searching out the hidden structure planes
within the rock, soon etches out a surface of the
most intricate detail. The effect of elevation
of the sea floor into the light of day will therefore
be to produce an even shore line devoid of
harbors (<a href="#f270">Fig. 270</a>). If the coast has risen
along visible planes of faulting near the sea
margin, the coast line, in addition to being even,
will usually be made up of notably straight elements
joined to one another.</p>

     <div class="cf"><p class="ch200"><span class="smcap">Fig. 271.</span>&mdash;Ragged coast line
of Alaska, the effect of subsidence.</p>
</div></div>

<p><b>A ragged coast line the mark of subsidence.</b>&mdash;When
in place of uplift a subsidence
occurs upon the coast,
the intricately etched
surface, resulting from
erosion beneath the
sky, comes to be invaded
by the sea
along each trench and
furrow, so that a most
ragged outline is the result (<a href="#f271">Fig. 271</a>).
Such a coast
has many
harbors,
while the
uplifted coast is as remarkable for its
lack of them.</p>

<p><b>Slow uplift of the coast&mdash;the
coastal plain and cuesta.</b>&mdash;A gradual
uplift of the coast is made apparent
in a progressive retirement of the sea
across a portion of its floor, thus exposing
this even surface of recent
sediments. The former shore land
will be easily recognized by it’s etched
surface, which will now come into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
sharp contrast with the new plain. It is therefore referred to as
the <i>oldland</i> and the newly exposed <i>coastal plain</i> as the <i>newland</i>
(<a href="#f272">Fig. 272</a>).</p>

<div class="floatleft">
     <img src="images/ill-305c.jpg" width="200" height="208" id="f272"

     <div class="cf"><p class="ch200"><span class="smcap">Fig. 272.</span>&mdash;Portion of Atlantic
coastal plain and neighboring oldland
of the Appalachian Mountains.</p>
</div></div>

<p>But the near-shore deposits upon the sea floor had an initial
dip or slope to seaward, and this inclination has been increased
in the process of uplift. The streams from the oldland have
trenched their way across these deposits while the shore was rising.
But the process being a slow one, deposits have formed
upon the seaward side of the plain after the landward portion was
above tide, and the coastal plain may come to have a “belted”
or zoned character. The streams tributary to those larger ones
which have trenched the plain may encounter in turn harder and
softer layers of the plain deposits, and at each hard layer will be
deflected along its margin so as to
enter the main streams more nearly
at right angles. They will also, as
time goes on, migrate laterally seaward
through undermining of the
harder layers, and thus will be
shaped alternating belts of lowland
separated by escarpments in the
harder rock from the residual higher slopes. Belts of upland of
this character upon a coastal plain are called <i>cuestas</i> (<a href="#f273">Fig. 273</a>).</p>

<div class="floatright">

and intermediate lowlands carved
from a coastal plain (after Davis).</p>
</div></div>

<p><b>The sudden uplifts of the coasts.</b>&mdash;Elevations of the coast
which yield the coastal plain must be accounted among the
slower earth movements that result in changes of level. Such
movements, instead of being accompanied by disastrous earthquakes,
were probably marked by frequent slight shocks only,
by subterranean rumblings, or, it may be, the land rose gradually
without manifestations of a sensible character.</p>

<p>Upon those coasts which are often in the throes of seismic disturbance,
a quite different effect is to be observed. Here within
the rocks we will probably find the marks of recent faulting with
large displacements, and the movements have been upon such a
scale that shore features, little modified by subsequent weathering,
stand well above the present level of the seas. Above such coasts,
then, we recognize the characteristic marks of wave action, and
the evidence that they have been suddenly uplifted is beyond
question.</p>

<p><b>The upraised cliff.</b>&mdash;Upon the coast of southern California
may be found all the features of wave-cut shores now in perfect
preservation, and in some cases as much as fifteen hundred feet
above the level of the sea. These features are monuments to the
grandest of earthquake disturbances which in recent time have
visited the region (<a href="#f274">Fig. 274</a>). Quite as striking an example of
similar movements is afforded by notched cliffs in hard limestone
upon the shore of the Island of Celebes (<a href="#f275">Fig. 275</a>). But the coast
of California furnishes the other characteristic coast features in the
high sea arch and the stack as additional monuments to the recent
uplift. Let one but imagine the stacks which now form the Seal
Rocks off the Cliff House at San Francisco to be suddenly raised
high above the sea, and the forms which they would then present
would differ but little from those which are shown in <a href="#f276">Fig. 276</a>.</p>

<p><b>The uplifted barrier beach.</b>&mdash;Within the reëntrants of the
shore, the wave-cut cliff is, as we know, replaced by the barrier
beach, which takes its course across the entrance to a bay. After
an uplift, such a barrier composed of sand or shingle should be
connected with the headlands, often with a partially filled lagoon
behind it. Its cross section should be steep in the direction of
the lagoon, but quite gradual in front (<a href="#f277">Fig. 277</a>).</p>

</div></div>

<p><b>Coast terraces.</b>&mdash;Upon those shores where to-day high mountains
front the sea, the coast may generally be seen to rise in a series
of terraces (<a href="#f278">Fig. 278</a>). This
is notably true of those coasts
which are to-day racked by
earthquakes, such as is the
eastern margin of the Pacific
from Alaska to Patagonia.
The traveler by steamer along
the coast from San Francisco
to Chili has for weeks almost constantly in sight these giant steps
on which the mountains have been uplifted from the sea. In
Alaska we are fortunate in having the history of the later stages in
this uplift (<a href="#f279">Fig. 279</a>). As described in a former chapter, portions
of this shore rose in the month of September of the year 1899 in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
some places as high as forty-seven feet, to the accompaniment of
a terrific earthquake and sea wave. Above the terrace which
marks the beach line of 1899 there is a higher terrace of similar
form now overgrown with trees, but none the less clearly to be recognized
as a shore line of the past century
which preceded in the long sequence the
uplift of 1899.</p>

mouth, or estuary upon a
coastal plain.</p>
</div></div>

<p>As was noted in our study of earthquakes,
the recent instrumental records of
distant earthquakes tell us that the movements
upon the sea floor are many times
larger than those upon the continents, and
that while the mountainous coasts are generally
rising, the deeps of the sea are sinking.
The effect of this over-balance of
sinking, or resultant shrinking of the earth’s
shell, may be to compress the mountain
district and so cause the shore line to move
landward at the same time that it moves
upward (<a href="#f280">Fig. 280</a>).</p>


<p><b>The sunk or embayed coast.</b>&mdash;When
now, upon the other hand, a section of the
coast line sinks with reference to the sea,
the water invades all the near-shore valleys,
thus “drowning” them and yielding
the drowned river mouth or <i>estuary</i>.
If the relief of the shore was slight, as it generally is upon a
coastal plain, slight depression only will produce broad estuaries,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
such as Chesapeake Bay at the
drowned mouth of the Susquehanna
(<a href="#f281">Fig. 281</a>).</p>

<p>If, on the other hand, the relief
of the shore is strong and the subsidence
is large, the entire coast
line will be transformed into an
archipelago of steep-walled rocky
islets which rise abruptly from the
sea (<a href="#f282">Figs. 282</a> and <a href="#f284">284</a>). A plateau
which is intersected by deep and
steep-walled valleys of <span class="font">U</span>-section
(<a href="#Page_341">p. 341</a>) under large submergence
yields the <i>fjords</i> so characteristic
of Scandinavia or Alaska. A ragged
coast line, fringed with islands
as a result of submergence, is described
as an <i>embayed coast</i>.</p>

</div></div>

<p><b>Submerged river channels.</b>&mdash;The
sinking of a coast of small
relief be sufficient to completely
submerge river valleys,
whose channels then begin to fill<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
with sediment and whose courses can only be followed in soundings.
One of the most interesting of such channels is that which
continues the Hudson River across the continental shelf into the
deeper sea (<a href="#f283">Fig. 283</a>).</p>


<p><b>Records of an oscillation of movement.</b>&mdash;Because a coast
is deeply embayed is no ground for assuming that a subsidence
is now in progress,
or is, in
fact, the latest
movement recorded
upon the
coast. In many
cases it is easy
to see that such
is not the case.
The coast of
Maine is perhaps
as typical
of an embayed
shore line as
any that might
be cited, but a
study of the
river valleys in
the neighborhood
shows clearly that the present submergence of their mouths
is a fraction only of an earlier one which has left a record of its
existence in beds of marine clay which outline the earlier and far
deeper indentations (<a href="#f284">Fig. 284</a>).</p>

<p>If now we give a closer examination to the coast, it is found
that there are marks of recent uplift in an abandoned shore line
now far above the reach of the waves. There is here, then, the
record, first of subsidence and consequent embayment, and, later,
of an uplift which has reduced the raggedness of the coast outline
exposed the clay deposits, and raised the strands of the period of
deep subsidence to their present position.</p>

<p>In countries which possess a more ancient civilization than our
own, the record of such oscillations in the level of the ground has
sometimes been entered upon human monuments, so that it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
possible to date more or less definitely the periods of subsidence
or elevation. At the little town of Pozzuoli, upon the shore of
the Bay of Naples, is found one of the mos instructive of these
records.</p>

columns of the temple of Jupiter Serapis
at Pozzuoli, showing the dark
and rough band nine feet in width
affected by the rock-boring mollusks
which now live in the Bay of Naples.</p>
</div></div>

<p>In the ruins of the ancient temple of Jupiter Serapis are three
marble monoliths 40 feet in height, curiously marked by a
roughened surface between the
heights of 12 and 21 feet above
their pedestals (<a href="#f285">Fig. 285</a>). Closer
inspection shows that this roughened
surface has been produced
by a marine, rock-boring mollusk,
the <i>lithodomus</i>, which lives in the
waters of the Bay of Naples, and
the shells of this animal are still
to be found within the cavities
upon the surface of the columns.
Without recounting details which
have been many times recited
since these interesting monuments
were first geologically explored
by Babbage and Lyell, it may be stated that a record is
here preserved, first of subsidence amounting to some 40 feet, and
of subsequent elevation, of the low coast land on which stood the
temple in the old Roman city of Puteoli (<a href="#f286">Fig. 286</a>).</p>

<p>At the time of deepest submergence the top of the lithodomus
zone upon the column stood at the level of the water in the Bay of
Naples, the smoother lower zone being buried at the time in the
sand at the bottom, and thus made inaccessible for the lithodomi.
It is to be added that studies made in the environs of Pozzuoli
have fully confirmed the changes of level revealed by the columns,
through the discovery of now elevated shore lines which are referable
to the period of deep submergence.</p>


<p><b>Simultaneous contrary movements upon a coast.</b>&mdash;In our
study of the changes in the level of the ground that take place
during earthquakes, it was learned that neighboring sections of
the earth’s crust may be moved at different rates or even in opposite
directions, notwithstanding the fact that the general movement
of the province is one of uplift. Thus during the Alaskan
earthquake of 1899, although portions of the coast line were elevated
by as much as forty-seven feet, neighboring sections were raised by
smaller amounts, and some small sections were sunk and so far
submerged that the salt water and the beach sand were washed
about the roots of forest trees.</p>

<p>A region racked by heavy earthquakes, where the present configuration
of the ground speaks strongly for a movement of somewhat
similar nature, but with average movement of elevation much
greater to the northward than in the opposite direction, is the extended
coast line of Chili. This country is characterized by a
great central north and south valley which separates the coast
range from the high chain of the Cordilleras to the eastward. To
the southward the floor of this valley descends, and has its continuance
in the Gulf of Corcovado behind the island of Chiloe and
the Chonos archipelago. The known recent uplift of the coast of
Chili, particularly in the northern sections and during the earthquakes
of the eighteenth, nineteenth, and twentieth centuries,
lends great interest to this topographic peculiarity. Indications
are not lacking that, during the earthquake of Concepcion in
1835, and of Valparaiso in 1907, the measure of uplift was greater
to the north than it was to the south.</p>

</div></div>

<p><b>The contrasted islands of San Clemente and Santa Catalina.</b>&mdash;Perhaps
the most striking example of simultaneous opposite movements
observable in neighboring portions of the earth’s crust
is furnished by the coast of southern California. The coast itself
at San Pedro and the island of San Clemente, some fifty miles off
this point, in common with most portions of the neighboring coast
land, have been rising in interrupted movements from the sea, and
offer in rare perfection the characteristic coast terraces (<a href="#f287">Fig. 287</a>
and <a href="#f278">Fig. 278</a>, <a href="#Page_250">p. 250</a>). Midway between these two rising sections
of the crust, and less than twenty-five miles distant from either, is
the island of Santa Catalina, which has been sinking beneath the
waves, and apparently at a similarly rapid rate (<a href="#f288">Fig. 288</a>). The
topography of the island shows the intricate detail of a maturely
eroded surface, while that of the neighboring San Clemente shows
only the widely spaced, deep cañons of the infantile stage of erosion
(<a href="#f165">Fig. 165</a> and <a href="#p12a">pl. 12 A</a>). While Santa Catalina has been sinking,
San Pedro Hill has risen 1240 feet, and San Clemente, 1500 feet.
It is characteristic of a sinking coast line that the cliff recession is
abnormally rapid, and evidence for this is furnished by the shores
of Santa Catalina, upon which the waves are cutting the cliffs
back into the beds of cañons, and so causing small falls to develop
at the cañon mouths.</p>

<p><b>The Blue Grotto of Capri.</b>&mdash;We may now return to the Bay
of Naples for additional evidence that oscillations of level in
neighboring portions of the same coast are not necessarily synchronous,
and that near-lying sections may even move in opposite
directions at the same time, as has already been shown for the islands
off the California coast. For the Pozzuoli shore of the bay
it was learned that within the Christian Era a complete cycle of
downward, followed by later upward, movement has been largely
accomplished. Across the bay, and less than 20 miles distant, is
the Blue Grotto of Capri, a sea cave cut in limestone above an
earlier cave of the same nature which is now deep below the water
surface. It is the refracted sunlight which enters the cave through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
this lower submerged opening and has been robbed on the way of
all but its blue rays which gives to the famous grotto its special
charm (<a href="#f289">Fig. 289</a>).</p>

<div class="floatleft">

showing the submerged sea cave through which most of the light enters
the grotto, and the higher artificial window now widened by wave action
(after von Knebel).</p>
</div></div>

<p>It is known that the former, and now submerged, sea cave was
in use by Roman patricians as a
cool retreat from the oppressive
hot wind known as the sirocco,
and that an artificial entrance or
window was cut where is now the
only accessible entrance to the
grotto. In the ancient writings,
no mention is made, however, of
the remarkable blue illumination
for which it is now famous, and
the conditions at the time, as we
may see, were not such as to make
this possible. Later subsidence
of the coast has brought the
ancient window to the sea level, where it has been considerably
enlarged by the waves. The earlier grotto, abandoned as its
entrance was closed, was rediscovered in 1826 by the painter and
poet, August Kopisch.</p>

<p>A grotto with green illumination (the Grotto Verde) is situated
upon the opposite side of the island, and a blue grotto, having its
origin in similar conditions to those of the famous Blue Grotto,
is found upon the island of Busi off the Dalmatian coast.</p>

<p><b>Character profiles.</b>&mdash;In the landscape of a coast which has been
slowly uplifted the characteristic line is the profile of the cuesta,
with short perpendicular element joined to a gently sloping and
longer section and continued in the horizontal portion corresponding
to the lowland (<a href="#f290">Fig. 290</a>). Rapidly uplifted coasts offer in
contrast the lines characteristic of wave erosion and deposition,
but at higher levels and in repeated sections. Most prominent
of all is the staircase constructed of coast terraces, with either
vertical or sloping risers and with outwardly inclining and gently
graded treads. Near the steep riser in the staircase may sometimes
be seen the sugar-loaf outline of the stack cut in softer material,
or the obelisk-like pillar undercut at its base, which is carved
in firmer rock masses. With excessively rapid uplift, the double-notched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
cliff or the double sea arch may appear in the landscape.
Upon a submerged coast the most significant lines in the view
are those of the rock islet and the steep-walled fjord.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XX</h2>

<p class="pch">THE GLACIERS OF MOUNTAIN AND CONTINENT</p>

<p><b>Conditions essential to glaciation.</b>&mdash;Wherever for a sufficiently
protracted period the annual snowfall of a district is in
excess of the snow that is melted, a residue must remain from
each season to be added to that of succeeding ones. Eventually
so much snow will have accumulated that under its own weight
and in obedience to its peculiar properties, a movement will begin
within the mass tending to spread it and so to reduce the slope
of its upper surface (<a href="#p1">Frontispiece plate</a>). The conditions favorable
to glaciation are, therefore, heavy precipitation and low annual
temperature. If the precipitation is scanty, the small snowfall
is soon melted; and if the temperature be too high, the moisture
is precipitated not in the form of snow but as rain. It is important
here to keep in mind that snow is a poor heat conductor
and itself protects its deeper layers from melting.</p>


<p><b>The snow-line.</b>&mdash;Because of the low temperatures glaciers
should be most abundant or most extensive in high latitudes and
in high altitudes. The largest are found in polar and subpolar
regions, and they are elsewhere encountered only at considerable
elevations. The largest glaciers are the vast sheets of ice which
inwrap the continents of Greenland and Antarctica, but glaciers
of large size are to be found upon other large land masses of the
Arctic, as well as in Alaska, in the southern Andes, and in New
Zealand. Much smaller glaciers are characteristic of certain
highlands within temperate and tropical regions, but because
of specially favorable conditions both of altitude and precipitation
the Himalayas, although in relatively low latitudes, nourish
glaciers of large proportions. In general, it may be said that
the nourishing grounds of glaciers are largely restricted to those
areas where snow covers the ground throughout the year. The
lower margin of such areas is designated the <i>snow line</i>, and varies
but little from the line on which the average summer temperature
is at the freezing point of water&mdash;the so-called <i>summer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
isotherm of 32° Fahrenheit</i>. Within the tropics this line may
rise as high as 18,000 feet above the sea, whereas in polar latitudes
it descends to sea level.</p>

<p><b>Importance of mountain barriers in initiating glaciers.</b>&mdash;The
precipitation within any district depends, however, not alone
upon the amount of moisture which is brought to it in the clouds,
but upon the amount which is abstracted before the clouds have
passed over it. The capacity of space to hold moisture increases
with its temperature, and hence any lowering of this temperature
will reduce the capacity. If lowered sufficiently, the point of
complete saturation will be reached and further cooling must
result in precipitation. Hence, anything which forces an air
current to rise into more rarefied zones above, will lower the pressure
upon it and so bring about a cooling effect in which no heat
is abstracted. This so-called <i>adiabatic refrigeration</i> of a gas
may be illustrated by the cool current which issues in a jet from
a warm expanded rubber tire after the cock has been opened; or
even better, by the instant solidification at extreme low temperatures
of such normal gases as carbonic acid when they are allowed
to issue under heavy pressure from a small orifice.</p>

<p>As applied to moisture-laden and near-surface winds, the
effective agents of adiabatic cooling are the upland areas upon
the continents, and especially the ranges of mountains. These
barriers force the moving clouds to rise, cool, and deposit their
moisture. It is, therefore, the highland barriers which face the
oncoming, moisture-laden winds that receive the heaviest precipitation.
Within temperate regions, because of the prevalence
of westerly winds, those barriers which face the western shores
receive the heaviest fall. Within the tropics, on the other hand,
it is the barriers facing the eastern shores which, because of the
easterly “trades”, are most favorable to precipitation.</p>

<p>Thus it is in the Sierra Nevadas of California, and not in the
Rockies or the Appalachians, that the glaciers of the United States
are found. The highland of the Swiss Alps lying likewise athwart
the “westerlies” of the temperate zone acquires the moisture
for nourishment of its glaciers from the western ocean&mdash;here
the Atlantic (<a href="#f291">Fig. 291</a>). Within the tropics the conditions are
reversed, and it is in general the ranges which lie nearer the eastern
coasts that are the more favored. If no barrier is found upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
this coast, the clouds may travel over vast stretches of country
before being arrested by mountains and robbed of their moisture.
Thus in tropical Brazil the glaciers are found in the Andes upon
the Pacific coast though nourished by clouds from the Atlantic.</p>

wind poles of the earth.</p>
</div></div>

<p><b>Sensitiveness of glaciers to temperature changes.</b>&mdash;How
sensitive is the adjustment between snow precipitation and temperature
may be strikingly illustrated by the statement on excellent
authority that if the average annual temperature of the air
within the Scottish Highlands should be lowered by only three
degrees Fahrenheit, small glaciers would be the result; and a
moderate temperature fall within the region surrounding the
Laurentian lakes of North America would bring on glaciation,
otherwise expressed as a depression of the snow line of the region.</p>


<p><b>The cycle of glaciation.</b>&mdash;Though to-day buried beneath its
ice mantle, it is known that Greenland had more than once in earlier
geological ages a notably mild climate, and in some future age
it may revert to this condition. In other regions, also, we have
evidence that such a rotation of climatic changes has been successively
accomplished, the climate having steadily increased in
severity towards a culminating point, and been followed by a
reverse series of changes. Such a complete period may be called
a <i>cycle of glaciation</i>. While the climate is steadily becoming
more rigorous, we have to do with an <i>advancing hemicycle</i> of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
glaciation, but after the culminating point has been reached, the
period of amelioration of climate is the <i>receding hemicycle</i>.</p>

<p><b>The advancing hemicycle.</b>&mdash;There is little reason to doubt
that whatever be the cause of the climatic changes which bring
on glacial conditions, these changes come on by insensible gradations.
The first visible evidence of the increased severity of
the climate is the longer persistence of the winter snows, at first
within the more elevated districts. In such positions drifts must
eventually continue throughout the warm season and so contribute
to the snow accumulations of the succeeding winter. This
point once reached, small glaciers are inevitable, even should the
average temperature fall no further, for the snow left over in
each season must steadily increase the depth of the deposits until
the weight brings about an internal motion of the mass from higher
to lower levels.</p>

<p>The inherited depressions of the upland&mdash;the gentle hollows
at the heads of rivers&mdash;will first be filled, and so the valleys<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
below become the natural channels for the outflow of the early
glaciers. With a continued lowering of the annual temperature
and consequent increased snowfall, the early glaciers become
more and more amply nourished. Snow and ice will, therefore,
cover larger areas of the upland, and the glaciers will push their
fronts farther down the valleys before they are wasted in the
warm air of the lower levels. As the valleys become thus more
completely invested by the glacier they are likewise filled to greater
and greater depths, and they may thus submerge portions of the
walls that separate adjacent valleys. Reaching at last the front
of the upland area, the glaciers may now be so well nourished at
their heads that they push out upon the flatter foreland and without

<p>The culmination of the progressive climatic change may ere
this have been reached and milder conditions have ensued. If,
however, the severity of the climate should be still further increased,
the expanded fronts of neighboring glaciers will coalesce
to form a common ice fan or apron along the foot of the upland
(<a href="#p18b">Plate 18 B</a>). This could hardly take place without a still further
deepening of the ice within the valleys above, and, probably, a
progressive submergence of the lower crests in the valley walls.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
This may even continue until all parts of the upland area have
been buried. The snow and ice now take the form of a covering
cap or carapace, and the upper portions being no longer restrained
at the sides, now spread into a broad dome, as would a viscous
liquid like thick molasses when poured out upon the floor (<a href="#f293">Fig. 293</a>).
The lower zones of the mass and the thinner marginal
portions still have their motion to a greater or less extent controlled
by the irregularity of the rock floor against which they rest.</p>

<p>The reverse series of changes in the glacier is inaugurated by an
amelioration of the climate, and here, therefore, the advancing
hemicycle becomes merged in the receding hemicycle of glaciation.</p>


<p><b>Continental and mountain glaciers contrasted.</b>&mdash;The time
when the rock surface becomes submerged beneath the glacier
is, as regards both the surface forms and the erosive work, a critical
point of much significance; for the ice cap and larger continental
glacier obviously protect the rock surface from the action
of those chemical and mechanical processes in which the atmosphere
enters as chief agent, and which are collectively known as weathering
processes. Until submergence is accomplished, larger or
smaller portions of the rock surface project either through or
between the ice masses and are, therefore, exposed to direct
attack by the weather (see below, <a href="#Page_370">p. 370</a>).</p>

<p>Snow which falls in the mountains is not allowed to remain
long where it falls. By the first high wind it is swept off the
more elevated and exposed surfaces and collected under eddies in
any existing hollows, but especially those upon the lee slopes of
the range. We are to learn that glaciers carve the mountains by
enlarging the hollows which they find and producing great basins
for the collection of their snows; but with the initiation of glaciation
the inherited hollows are in most cases the unimportant
depressions at the heads of streams. Whatever they may be
and however formed, the snow first fills those hollows which are
sheltered from the wind, and as it accumulates and becomes
distributed as ice, assumes a surface of its own that is dependent
upon the form and the position of the basin which it occupies
(see <a href="#f294">Fig. 294</a>).</p>

<p>When the quantity of accumulated snow is so great that all
hollows of the rock surface are filled, its own surface is no longer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
controlled by retaining rock walls, and it now assumes a form
largely independent of the irregularities in the upland. Experience
shows that this surface is approximately that of a flat dome
or shield, and as it covers all the upland, save where the ice thins
upon its margins, this type of glacier is called an <i>ice cap</i> (<a href="#f295">Fig. 295</a>).
All types of glacier in which rock projects above the
highest levels of the ice and snow are known as <i>mountain glaciers</i>.</p>

<p>The flat domes of ice which mantle the continents of Greenland
and Antarctica, though resembling in form the smaller ice
cap, are yet because of their vast size so distinct from them, particularly
in the manner of their nourishment, that they belong in
a separate class described as <i>inland ice</i> or <i>continental glaciers</i>.
Though they have some affinities with ice caps, they are most
sharply differentiated from all types of mountain glaciers. Of them
it is true that the lithosphere projects through them only in the
neighborhood of their margins (<a href="#f296">Fig. 296</a>), whereas in the case of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
mountain glaciers rock may project at any level but <i>always above
the highest snow surface</i>. Ice caps may be regarded as intermediate
between the two main classes of mountain and continental
glaciers (<a href="#f297">Fig. 297</a>). Because of the large rôle which continental
glaciers have played in geological history, it is thought best to consider
them first, leaving for later discussion the no less interesting
but less important mountain glaciers.</p>

</div></div>

<p><b>The nourishment of glaciers.</b>&mdash;The life of a glacier is dependent
upon the continued deposition of snow in aggregate amount
in excess of that which is lost by melting or by other depleting
processes. Whenever, on the other hand, the waste exceeds the
precipitation, the glacier is in a receding condition and must
eventually disappear, if such conditions are sufficiently long continued.
The source of the snow is the water of the ocean evaporated
into the atmosphere and transported over the land in the
form of clouds. We are to learn that the changes which this
moisture undergoes before its delivery to the glacier are notably
different for the classes of continental and mountain glacier.</p>


<p><b>The upper and lower cloud zones of the atmosphere.</b>&mdash;Before
we can comprehend the nature of the processes by which glaciers
are nourished, it will be necessary to review the results of
recent studies made upon the earth’s atmospheric envelope. It
must be kept in mind that the sun’s rays are chiefly effective in
warming the atmosphere through being first absorbed by some
solid body such as rock or water and their heat then communicated
by contact to the immediately adjacent air layers. The layers thus
warmed being now lighter than before, they rise and are replaced
by colder air, which in its turn is warmed and likewise set in upward
motion. Such currents developed in the air by contact
with warmer solid bodies constitute the process known as convection.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter">

     <div class="caption"><p class="pc400"><span class="smcap">Fig. 298.</span>&mdash;The zones of the lower atmosphere as revealed by recent kite and
balloon explorations.</p>
</div></div>

<p>To a relatively small degree the atmosphere is heated by the
direct absorption of the sun’s rays which pass through it. Since
air has weight, it compresses the lower layers near the earth, and
hence as we ascend from the earth’s surface the air becomes continually
lighter. Convection currents must, therefore, adjust
themselves by the air expanding as it rises. But expansion of a
gas always results in its cooling, as every one must have observed
who has placed his finger in the air current which escapes from
the open valve of a warm rubber tire. Dry air is cooled a degree
Fahrenheit for every six hundred feet of ascent in the atmosphere.
At a height of about seven miles above the earth’s surface
all rising air currents have cooled to about 68° below the
zero of the Fahrenheit scale, and exploration with balloons has
shown that the currents rise no farther. At this level they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
move horizontally, just as rising vapor spreads out in a room beneath
the ceiling. Above this level, as far as exploration has gone,
or to a height of more than twelve miles, the temperature remains
nearly constant, and this upper zone is, therefore, called the <i>isothermal</i>
or the <i>advective zone</i>&mdash;the uniform temperature zone
of the lower atmosphere. Beneath the convective ceiling the
process of convection is characteristic, and this zone is therefore
described as the <i>convective zone</i> (<a href="#f298">Fig. 298</a>).</p>

<p>A large part of the moisture which rises from the ocean’s surface
is condensed to vapor before it has ascended three miles, and in
this form it makes its transit over land as fleecy or stratiform
clouds&mdash;the so-called cumulus and stratus clouds and their many
intermediate varieties (see Frontispiece). This lower layer within
the convective zone is, therefore, a moist one overlaid by a relatively
drier middle layer of the convective zone. That moisture
which rises above the lower cloud layer is congealed by adiabatic
cooling to fine ice needles visible as the so-called cirrus
clouds which float as feathery fronds beneath the convective
ceiling (see frontispiece at right upper corner of picture). Thus
we have within the convective zone an upper layer more or less
charged with water in the form of ice needles. It is the clouds
of the lower zone whose moisture in the form of vapor supplies
the nourishment of mountain glaciers, and the high cirrus clouds
whose congealed moisture, after interesting transformations, is
responsible for the continued existence of continental glaciers.</p>

<p>As we are to see, there are other noteworthy differences between
continental and mountain glaciers, in the manner of their
sculpture of the lithosphere, so that long after they have disappeared
the characters of each are easily identified in their handiwork.
How the lower clouds are forced upward and so compelled
to give up their moisture to feed the mountain glaciers, and how
the upper clouds are pulled downward to nourish the glaciers of
continents, can be best understood after the characteristics of
each glacier class have been studied.</p>

<p><b>The inland ice of Greenland.</b>&mdash;In Greenland and in Antarctica
the land is almost or quite buried under a cover of snow and
ice&mdash;the so-called “inland ice”&mdash;which
always assumes the
surface of a very flat dome or
shield. In Greenland there is
found a marginal ribbon of
land generally from five to
twenty-five miles in width
(<a href="#f299">Fig. 299</a>), but in Antarctica
all the land, with the exception
of a few mountain peaks,
is inwrapped in a mantle of
ice which is also extended upon
the sea in a broad shelf of snow
and ice. Neither of these vast
glaciers has been explored except
in its marginal portion,
yet such is the symmetry of
the profiles along the routes
traversed, and such the flatness
and monotony of the snow
surface within the margins,
that there is little reason to
doubt that the profile made
along Nansen’s route in southern
Greenland would, save only
for magnitude, fairly represent a section across the middle of the
continent (<a href="#f300">Fig. 300</a>).</p>

<p><b>The mountain rampart and its portals.</b>&mdash;As soon as we examine
the coastal belt we observe that the “Great Ice” of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
Greenland is held in by a wall of mountains and so prevented from
spreading out to its natural surface in the marginal portions.
Through portals of the inclosing mountain ranges&mdash;the <i>outlets</i>&mdash;it
sends out <i>tongues</i> of ice which in many respects resemble
certain types of mountain glaciers.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

are represented below upon a magnified scale in order to bring out the characters
of the marginal slopes.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Such measurements as have been made upon the inland ice
of Greenland at points back from, but yet comparatively near to,
the outlets, show that it has here a surface rate of motion amounting
to less than an inch per day, and it is highly probable that at
moderate distances from the margin this amount diminishes to
zero. Upon the outlets, on the contrary, surface rates as high as
59 feet per day have been measured, and even 100 feet per day has
been reported. We are thus justified in saying that glacier flow
within the outlets is from 700 to 1000 times as great as it is upon
the near-by inland ice, and that the glacier is in a measure drained
through the portals of the inclosing ranges. Back from these
outlet streams of ice, or tongues, the surface of the inland ice is
depressed to form a dimple or “basin of exudation” as is the surface
of a reservoir above the raceway when the water is being rapidly
drawn away (<a href="#f301">Fig. 301</a>).</p>

<p>Fissures in the ice, the so-called crevasses, are the recognized
marks of ice movement, and these are always concentrated at the
steep slopes of the ice surface in the neighborhood of its margins.
Upon the Greenland ice, crevasses are restricted in their distribution
to a zone which extends from seven to twenty-five miles
within the ice border.</p>

<p><b>The marginal rock islands.</b>&mdash;From its margin the ice surface
rises so steeply as to be climbed only with difficulty, but this
gradient steadily diminishes until at a distance of between seventy-five
and a hundred miles its slope is less than two degrees. Where
crossed by Nansen near latitude 64° N. the broad central area of
ice was so nearly level as to
appear to be a plain.</p>

<p>As we pass across the irregular
ice margin in the direction
of the interior, larger and larger
proportions of the land’s surface
are submerged, until only
projecting peaks rise above
the ice as islands which are
described as <i>nunataks</i> (<a href="#f302">Fig. 302</a>).</p>

<p>Though not a universal observation,
it has been often
noted that the absorption of
the sun’s rays by rock masses
projecting through the snow
results in a radiation of the
heat and a lowering by melting
of the surrounding snow and
ice. For this reason nunataks
are often surrounded by a deep
trench due to a melting of the
snow. Such a depression in
the ice surface about the margin
of a nunatak, from its resemblance
to a trench about
an ancient castle, has been
designated a <i>moat</i> (<a href="#f303">Fig. 303</a>).
For the same reason, the outlet
tongues of ice which descend
in deep fjords between walls of
rock are melted away from
the walls and a lateral stream
of water is sometimes found
to flow between ice and rock
(<a href="#p13b">pl. 13 B</a>).</p>

</div></div>

<p><b>Rock fragments which travel with the ice.</b>&mdash;Rock surfaces
which are exposed to the atmosphere are in high latitudes broken
down through the freezing
of water within their
crevices. The fragments
resulting from
this rending process fall
upon the glacier surface
and are carried forward
as passengers in the direction
of the ice margin. They are either
visible as long and narrow
ridges or trains following
the directions of
the steepest slope (<a href="#f302">Fig. 302</a>),
or they become buried under fresh falls of snow and only
again become visible where summer melting has lowered the glacier
surface in the vicinity of its margin. These longitudinal trains of
rock fragments upon the glacier surface always have their starting
point at the lower margin of one of the nunataks, and are known
as <i>medial moraines</i> (<a href="#f301">Fig. 301</a>, <a href="#Page_273">p. 273</a>, and <a href="#f302">Fig. 302</a>). Inside
the zone of nunataks the glacier surface is, however, clear of rock
débris except where dust has
been blown on by the wind,
and this extends for a few
miles only. The material of
the medial moraines is a collection
of angular blocks whose
surfaces are the result of frost
rending, for in their travel
above the ice they are subjected
to no abrading processes.</p>

<p>A contrasted type of surface
moraines upon the Greenland
glacier, instead of being parallel
to the direction of ice movement, is directed transversely or
parallel to the margins. The materials of these moraines are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
more rounded fragments of rock which have come up from the
bottom layers, and we shall again refer to the origin of such
moraines after the subglacial conditions have been considered.</p>


<p><b>The grinding mill beneath the ice.</b>&mdash;If, now, we examine the
front of a glacier tongue which goes out from the inland ice, we
find that while the upper portion is white and mainly free from rock
débris (<a href="#p13a">plate 13 A</a>), the lower zone is of a dark color and crowded
with layers of pebbles and bowlders which have been planed,
polished, and scratched in a quite remarkable manner. The ice
front is itself subject to forward and retrograde migrations of short
period, but it is easily seen that in the main its larger movement
has been a retrograde one. The ground from which it has lately
withdrawn is generally a hard rock floor unweathered, but smooth,
polished, and scratched in the same manner as the bowlders which
are imbedded within the ice. It is perfectly apparent that the
latter have been derived from some portion of the rock basement
upon which the glacier still rests, and that floor and bowlders have
alike been ground smooth by mutual contact under pressure.</p>

<p>This erosion beneath the ice is accomplished by two processes;
namely, <i>plucking</i> and <i>abrasion</i>. Wherever the rock over which
the glacier moves has stood up in projecting masses and is riven
by fissure planes of any kind, the ice has found it easy to remove
it in larger or smaller fragments by a quarrying process described
as plucking. The rock may be said to be torn away in blocks which
are largely bounded by the preëxisting fissure planes. Over relatively
even surfaces plucking has little importance, but where
there are noteworthy inequalities of surface upon the glacier bed,
those sides which are away from the oncoming ice (<i>lee</i> side) are
degraded by plucking in such a manner as sometimes to leave
steep and ragged fracture surfaces. The tools of the ice thus acquired
in the process of plucking are quickly frozen into the lowest
ice layers, and being now dragged along the floor they abrade in
the same manner as does a rasp or file. These tools of the ice are
themselves worn away in the process and are thus given their
characteristic shapes. Just as the lapidary grinds the surface of
a jewel into facets by imbedding the gem in a matrix, first in one
and then in another position, each time wearing down the projecting
irregularities through contact with the abrading surface;
so in like manner the rock fragment is held fast at the bottom of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
the glacier until “soled” or “shod”, first upon one side and then
upon another. Accidental contact with some obstruction upon
the floor may suffice to turn the fragment and so expose a new surface
to wear upon the abrading floor. Minor obstructions coming
in contact with one side of the fragment only, may turn it in
its own plane without overturning. Evidence of such interruptions
can be later read in the different directions of striæ upon
the same facet (<a href="#p17a">plate 17 A</a>).</p>

<div class="floatleft">

age in South Africa. The striæ
running in the direction of the observer are
prominent and a noteworthy gouging of the
surface is to be noted to the right in the
middle distance (after Davis).</p>
</div></div>

<p>The floor beneath the glacier is reduced by the abrading process
to a more or less smooth and generally flattened or rounded surface&mdash;the
so-called <i>glacier pavement</i> (<a href="#f304">Fig. 304</a>). To accomplish
this all former mantle rock
due to weathering processes
must first be cleared away,
and the firm unaltered rock
beneath is wherever susceptible
of it given a smooth
polish although locally
scored and scratched by the
grinding bowlders. The
earlier projections of the
surface of the floor, if not
entirely planed away, are
at least transformed into
rounded shoulders of rock,
which from their resemblance
to closely crowded backs in a flock of sheep have been
called “sheep backs” or “<i>roches moutonnées</i>.” Thus the effect
of the combined action of the processes of plucking and abrasion
is to reduce the accent of the relief and to mold the contours of
the rock in smoothly flowing curves, generally of large radius.</p>

<p><b>The lifting of the grinding tools and their incorporation
within the ice.</b>&mdash;Wherever the ice is locally held in check by the
projecting nunataks, relief is found between such obstructions,
and there the flow of the ice has a correspondingly increased velocity
(<a href="#f305">Fig. 305 <i>b</i></a>). If the obstructions are not of large dimensions,
the ice which flows around the outer edges is soon joined to that
which passes between the obstructions and so normal conditions
of flow are restored below the nunataks. The locally rapid flow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
of the ice is, therefore, restricted to a relatively short distance, the
passageway between the nunataks, and the conditions are thus
to be likened to the fall of water at a raceway due to the sudden
descent of its surface from the level of the reservoir to the level of
the stream in the outlet. As is well known, there is under these
conditions a prodigious scour upon the bottom which tends to dig
a pit just above and below the dam&mdash;a <i>scape colk</i>&mdash;and carry
the materials up to the surface below the pit. Such a tendency
was well illustrated by the behavior of the water at the opening
of the Neu Haufen dam below the city of Vienna (<a href="#f305">Fig. 305 <i>a</i></a>). In
the case of ice, material from the bottom may by the upward current
be brought up to the surface of the glacier at the lower edge
of the colk and thus produce a type of local surface moraine of
horseshoe form with its direction generally transverse to the direction
of ice movement (<a href="#f305">Fig. 305 <i>b</i></a>).</p>

<p>Any obstruction upon the pavement of the glacier apparently
exerts a larger or smaller tendency to elevate the bowlders and
pebbles and incorporate them within the ice. Rock débris thus
incorporated is described as <i>englacial</i> drift. In the case of Greenland
glaciers this material seems at the ice front to be largely restricted
to the lower 100 feet (<a href="#p13a">plate 13 A</a>).</p>

<p>Near the front of the inland ice the increased slope of the upper
surface greatly increases the flow of the upper ice layers in comparison<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
with those nearer the bottom, so that the upper layers
override the lower as they would an obstruction. The englacial
drift is either for this reason or because of rock obstructions
brought to the surface, where it yields parallel ridges corresponding
in direction to the glacier margin. Such transverse surface moraines
are thus in many respects analogous to those which appear
about the lower margins of scape colks. In contrast to the
longitudinal or medial surface moraines the materials of the transverse
moraines are more faceted and rounded&mdash;they have been
abraded upon the glacier pavement.</p>


<p><b>Melting upon the glacier margins in Greenland.</b>&mdash;During the
short but warm summer season, the margins of the Greenland ice
are subject to considerable losses through surface melting. When
the uppermost ice layer has attained a temperature of 32° Fahrenheit,
melting begins and moves rapidly inward from the glacier
margin. In late spring the surface of the outer marginal zone is
saturated with water, and this zone of slush advances inward with
the season, but apparently never transgresses the inner border of
what we have generally referred to as the marginal zone of the ice
characterized by relatively steep slopes, crevasses, and nunataks.
Upon the ice within this zone are found streams large enough to be
designated as rivers and these are connected with pools, lakes, and
morasses. The dirt and rock fragments imbedded in the ice are
melted out in the lowering of the surface, so that late in the season
the ice presents a most dirty aspect. At the front of the great
mountain glaciers of Alaska, a more vigorous operation of the same
process has yielded a surface soil in which grow such rank forests
as entirely to mask the presence of the ice beneath.</p>

<p>In addition to the visible streams upon the surface of the Greenland
ice, there are others which flow beneath and can be heard by
putting the ear to the surface. All surface streams eventually
encounter the marginal crevasses and plunge down in foaming
cascades, producing the well known “glacier wells” or “glacier
mills.” The progress of the water is now throughout in tunnels
within the ice until it again makes its appearance at the glacier
margin.</p>

<p><b>The marginal moraines.</b>&mdash;Study of both the Greenland and
Antarctic glaciers has shown that if we disregard the smaller and
short-period migrations of the ice front, the general later movement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
has been a retrograde one&mdash;we live in a receding hemicycle
of glaciation. The earlier Greenland glacier has now receded so
as to expose large areas of
the former glacier pavement.
In places this
pavement is largely bare,
indicating a relatively rapid
retirement of the ice front,
but at all points at which
the ice margin was halted
there is now found a ridge
of unassorted rock materials
which were dropped
by the ice as it melted (<a href="#f306">Fig. 306</a>).
Such ridges, composed
of the unassorted
materials described as <i>till</i>,
come to have a festooned arrangement largely concentric to the ice
margin, and are the <i>marginal</i> or <i>terminal moraines</i> (see <a href="#f336">Fig. 336</a>,
<a href="#Page_312">p. 312</a>). Marginal moraines, if of large dimensions, usually have a
hummocky surface, and are apt to be composed of rock fragments
of a wide range of size from rock flour (clay) to large bowlders
(<a href="#p17a">plate 17 A</a>), which may represent many types since they have
been plucked by the glacier
or gathered in at its surface
from many widely separated
localities.</p>

<p>As the glacier front retires
from the moraine which it
has built up, the water which
emerges from beneath the
ice is impounded behind the
new dam so as to form a
lake of crescentic outline
(<a href="#f307">Fig. 307</a>). Such lakes are
particularly short-lived, for
the reason that the water
finds an outlet over the lowest point in the crest of the moraine
and easily cuts a gorge through the loose materials, thus draining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
the lake (<a href="#f308">Fig. 308</a>). Thereafter, the escaping water flows in a
braided stream across the late lake bottom and thence at the
bottom of the gorge through the moraine.</p>

</div></div>

<p><b>The outwash plain or apron.</b>&mdash;The water which descends from
the glacier surface in the glacier wells or mills, eventually arrives
at the bottom, where it follows a sinuous course within a tunnel
melted out in the ice. Much of this water may issue at the ice
front beneath the coarse rock materials which are found there,
and so be discovered with the ear rather than by the eye. The
water within the tunnels not flowing with a free surface but being
confined as though it were in a pipe, may, however, reach the
glacier margin under a hydrostatic pressure sufficient to carry it
up rising grades. Inasmuch as it is heavily charged with rock
débris and is suddenly checked upon arriving at the front it deposits
its burden about the ice margin so as to build up plains of
assorted sands and gravels, and over this surface it flows in ever
shifting serpentine channels of braided type (<a href="#f308">Fig. 308</a>). Such
plains of glacier outwash are described as <i>outwash plains</i> or <i>outwash
aprons</i>.</p>

<p>Rising as it does under hydrostatic pressure the water issuing
at the glacier front may find its way upward in some of the crevasses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
and so emerge at a level considerably above the glacial
floor. It may thus come about that the outwash plain is built
up about the nose of the glacier so as partially to bury it from
sight. When now the ice front begins a rapid retirement, a depression
or <i>fosse</i> (<a href="#f309">Fig. 309</a> and <a href="#f339">Fig. 339</a>, <a href="#Page_314">p. 314</a>) is left behind the
outwash plain and in front of the moraine which is built up at the
next halting place.</p>

<p><b>The continental glacier of Antarctica.</b>&mdash;In Victoria Land, upon
the continent of Antarctica, so far as exploration has yet gone,
the continental glacier is held back by a rampart of mountains,
as has been shown to be true of the inland ice of Greenland. The
same flat dome or shield has likewise been found to characterize
its upper surface (<a href="#f310">Fig. 310</a>).</p>

<p>The most noteworthy differences between the inland ice masses
of Greenland and Antarctica are to be ascribed to the greater
severity of the Antarctic climate and to the more ample nourishment
of the southern glacier measured by the land area which it
has submerged. There is here no marginal land ribbon as in Greenland,
but the glacier covers all the land and is, moreover, extended
upon the sea as a broad floating terrace&mdash;the shelf ice (<a href="#f311">Fig. 311</a>).
This barrier at its margin puts a bar to all further navigation,
rising as it does in some cases 280 feet above the sea and descending
to even greater depths below (<a href="#p15b">plate 15 B</a>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span></p>

winds (based on maps by Scott and Shackleton).</p>
</div></div>

<p>In that portion of Antarctica which was explored by the German
expedition, the inland ice is not as in Victoria Land restrained
within walls of rock, but is spread out upon the continent so as to
assume its natural ice slopes, which are therefore much flatter
than those examined in Greenland and Victoria Land. Here in
Kaiser Wilhelm Land the ice rises at its sea margin in a cliff which
is from 130 to 165 feet in height, then upon a fairly steeply curving
slope to an elevation of perhaps a thousand feet. Here the grades
have become relatively level, and on ever flatter slopes the surface
appears to continue into the distant interior (<a href="#p14">plate 14</a>). Near
the ice margin numerous fissures betray a motion within the mass
which exact measurements indicate to be but one foot per day, and
at a distance of a mile and a quarter from the margin even this
slight value has diminished by fully one eighth. It can hardly
be doubted that at moderate distances only within the ice margin,
the glacier is practically without motion.</p>

<p>Rain or general melting conditions being unknown in Antarctica,
a striking contrast is offered to the marginal zone of the Greenland
continent. This is to a large extent explained by the existence
upon the northern land mass of a coastland ribbon which becomes
quickly heated in the sun’s rays, and both by warming the air and
by radiating heat to the ice it causes melting and produces local
air temperatures which in summer may even be described as hot.
About Independence Bay in latitude 82° N. and near the northernmost
extremity of Greenland, Peary descended from the inland
ice into a little valley within which musk oxen were lazily
grazing and where bees buzzed from blossom to blossom over a
gorgeous carpet of flowers.</p>

<p><b>Nourishment of continental glaciers.</b>&mdash;Explorations upon and
about the glaciers of Greenland and Antarctica have shown that
the circulation of air above these vast ice shields conforms to a
quite simple and symmetrical model subject to spasmodic pulsations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
of a very pronounced type. Each great ice mass with its
atmospheric cover constitutes a sort of refrigerating air engine
and plays an important part in the wind system of the globe.
(See <a href="#f291">Fig. 291</a>, <a href="#Page_263">p. 263</a>). Both the domed surface and the low temperature
of the glacier are essential to the continuation of this
pulsating movement within the atmosphere (<a href="#f312">Fig. 312</a>). The air
layer in contact with the ice is during a period of calm cooled, contracted,
and rendered heavier, so that it begins to slide downward
and outward upon the domed surface in all directions. The extreme
flatness of the greater portion of the glacier surface&mdash;a
fraction only of one degree&mdash;makes the engine extremely slow
in starting, but like all bodies which slide upon inclined planes,
the velocity of its movement is rapidly accelerated, until a blizzard
is developed whose vigor is unsurpassed by any elsewhere experienced.</p>

     <div class="caption"><p class="ch400"><span class="smcap">Fig. 312.</span>&mdash;Diagram to show the nature of the fixed glacial anticyclone above
continental glaciers and the process by which their surface is shaped.</p>
</div></div>

<p>The effect of such centrifugal air currents above the glacier is
to suck down the air of the upper currents in order to supply the
void which soon tends to develop over the central portion of the
glacier dome. This downward vortex, fed as it is by inward-blowing,
high-level currents, and drained by outwardly directed surface
currents, is what is known as an <i>anticyclone</i>, here fixed in
position by the central embossment of the dome.</p>

<p>The air which descends in the central column is warmed by
compression, or adiabatically, just as air is warmed which is forced
into a rubber tire by the use of a pump. The moisture congealed
in the cirrus clouds floating in the uppermost layer of the convective
zone, is carried down in this vortex and first melted and in
turn evaporated, due to the adiabatic effect. This fusion and
evaporation of the ice by its transformation of latent, to sensible,
heat, in a measure counteracts, and so retards, the adiabatic elevation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
of temperature within the column. Eventually the warm
air now charged with water vapor reaches the ice surface, is at
once chilled, and its burden of moisture precipitated in the form of
fine snow needles, the so-called “frost snow”, which in accompaniment
to the sudden elevation of temperature is precipitated at the
termination of a blizzard.</p>

<p>The warming of the air has, however, had the effect of damping
as it were, the engine stroke, and, as the process is continued, to
start a reverse or upward current within the chimney of the anticyclone.
The blizzard is thus suddenly ended in a precipitation
of the snow, which by changing the latent heat of condensation
to sensible heat tends to increase this counter current.</p>

</div></div>

<p><b>The glacier broom.</b>&mdash;During the calm which succeeds to the
blizzard, heat is once more abstracted from the surface air layer,
and a new outwardly directed engine stroke is begun. The tempest
which later develops acts as a gigantic centrifugal broom which
sweeps out to the margins of the glacier all portions of the latest
snowfall which have not become firmly attached to the ice surface.
The sweepings piled up about the margin of continental glaciers
have been described as fringing glaciers, or the glacial fringe. The
northern coast of Greenland and Grant Land are bordered by a
fringe of this nature (<a href="#p14">plate 14</a>, and <a href="#f315">Fig. 315</a>, <a href="#Page_288">p. 288</a>). It is by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
operation of the glacier broom that the inland ice is given its characteristic
shield-like shape (<a href="#f312">Fig. 312</a>). The granular nature of the
snow carried by the wind is well brought out by the little snow
deltas about the margins of Greenland ice tongues (<a href="#f313">Fig. 313</a>).
Obviously because of the presence of the vigorous anticyclone, no
snows such as nourish mountain glaciers can be precipitated upon
continental glaciers except within a narrow marginal zone, and,
as shown by Nansen rock dust from the coastland ribbon and
from the nunataks
of Greenland, is carried
by a few miles
inside the western
margin, and not
at all within the
eastern.</p>

<p><b>Field and pack
ice.</b>&mdash;Within polar
regions the surface
of the sea freezes
during the long
winter season, the
product being known as <i>sea-ice</i> or <i>field-ice</i> (<a href="#f314">Fig. 314</a>). This ice
cover may reach a thickness by direct freezing of eight or more
feet, and by breaking up and being crowded above and below
neighboring fragments may increase to a considerably greater
thickness. Ice thus crowded together and more or less crushed is
described as <i>pack ice</i> or <i>the pack</i>.</p>

<p>The pack does not remain stationary but is continually drifting
with the wind and tide, first in one direction and then in another,
but with a general drift in the direction of the prevailing winds.
Because of the vast dimensions of the pack, the winds over widely
separated parts may be contrary in direction, and hence when currents
blow toward each other or when the ice is forced against a
land area, it is locally crushed under mighty pressures and forced
up into lines of <i>hummocks</i>&mdash;the so-called <i>pressure ridges</i>. At
other times, when the winds of widely separated areas blow away
from each other, the pack is parted, with the formation of lanes or
<i>leads</i> of open water.</p>

<p>If seen in bird’s-eye view the lines of hummocks would according<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
to Nansen be arranged like the meshes of a net having roughly
squared angles and reaching to heights of 15 to 25, rarely 30, feet
above the general surface of the pack. The ice within each mesh of
the network is a <i>floe</i>, which at the times of pressure is ground against
its neighbors and variously shifted in position. At the margin of
the pack these floes become separated and float toward lower latitudes
until they are melted.</p>


<p><b>The drift of the pack.</b>&mdash;The discovery of the drift in the Arctic
pack is a romantic chapter in the history of polar exploration, and
has furnished an example of faith in scientific reasoning and judgment
which may well be compared with that of Columbus. The
great figure in this later discovery is the Norwegian explorer
Fridtjof Nansen, and to the final achievement the ill-fated <i>Jeannette</i>
expedition contributed an important part.</p>

<p>The <i>Jeannette</i> carrying the American exploring expedition
was in 1879 caught in the pack to the northward of Wrangel Island
(<a href="#f315">Fig. 315</a>), and two years later was crushed by the ice and sunk to
the northward of the New Siberian Islands. In 1884 various
articles, including a list of stores in the handwriting of the commander
of the <i>Jeannette</i>, were picked up at Julianehaab near the
southern extremity of Greenland but upon the western side of
Cape Farewell. Nansen, having carefully verified the facts,
concluded that the recovered articles could have found their way
to Julianehaab only by drifting in the pack across the polar sea,
and that at the longest only five years had been consumed in the
transit. After being separated from the pack the articles must
have floated in the current which makes southward along the east
coast of Greenland and after doubling Cape Farewell flows northward
upon the west coast. It was clear that if they had come
through Smith Sound they would inevitably have been found
upon the other shore of Baffin Bay. In confirmation of this view
there was found at Godthaab, a short distance to the northward
of Julianehaab (<a href="#f315">Fig. 315</a>), an ornamented Alaskan “throwing
stick” which probably came by the same route. Moreover,
large quantities of driftwood reach the shores of Greenland which
have clearly come from the Siberian coast, since the Siberian
larch has furnished the larger quantity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span></p>

<p>Pinning his faith to these indubitable facts, Nansen built the
<i>Fram</i> in such a manner as to resist and elude the enormous pressures
of the ice pack, stocked her with provisions sufficient for
five years, and by allowing the vessel to be frozen into the pack
north of the New Siberian Islands, he consigned himself and
his companions to the mercy of the elements. The world knows
the result as one of the most remarkable achievements in
the long history of polar exploration. The track of the <i>Fram</i>,
charted in <a href="#f315">Fig. 315</a>, considered in connection with that of the
<i>Jeannette</i>, shows that the Arctic pack drifts from Bering Sea westward
until near the northeastern coast of Greenland.</p>

<p>Special casks were for experimental purposes fastened in the
ice to the north of Behring Strait by Melville and Bryant, and two
of these were afterwards recovered, the one near the North Cape
in northern Norway, and the other in northeastern Iceland (see
map, <a href="#f315">Fig. 315</a>). Peary’s trips northward in 1906 and 1909 from
the vicinity of Smith Sound have indicated that between the Pole
and the shores of Greenland and Grant Land the drift is throughout
to the eastward, corresponding to the westerly wind. Upon
this border the great area of Arctic drift ice is in contact with
great continental glaciers bordered by a glacier fringe. Admiral
Peary has shown that instead of consisting of frozen sea ice, the
pack is here made up of great floes from 20 to 100 feet in thickness
and that these have been derived from the glacier fringe.</p>

<p>Whenever the blizzards blow off the inland ice from the south,
leads are opened at the margin of the fringe and may carry strips
from the latter northward across the lead. With favorable conditions
these leads may be closed by thick sea ice so that with
the occurrence of counter winds from the north they do not entirely
return to their original position. A continuance of this process
may have resulted in the heavy floe ice to the northward of Greenland,
which, acting as an obstruction, may have forced the thinner
drift ice to keep on the European side of the Arctic pack.</p>

that the inland ice of Antarctica is in part at least surrounded by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
a thick snow and ice terrace floating upon the sea and rising to
heights of more than 150 feet above it (<a href="#p15b">plate 15 B</a> and <a href="#f316">Fig. 316</a>).
The visible portions of this shelf-ice are of stratified compact
snow, and the areas which have thus far been studied are found
in bays from which dislodgment is less easily effected. The origin
of the shelf ice is believed to be a sea-ice which because not easily
detached at the time of the spring “break-up” is thickened in
succeeding seasons chiefly by the deposition of precipitated and
drifted snow upon its
surface, so that it is
bowed down under
the weight and sunk
to greater and greater
depths in the water.
To some extent, also,
it is fed upon its inner
margin by overflow
of glacier ice from
the inland ice masses.</p>

<p><b>Icebergs and snowbergs and the manner of their birth.</b>&mdash;Greenland
reveals in the character of its valleys the marks of a large
subsidence of the continent&mdash;the serpentine inlets or fjords by
which its coast is so deeply indented. Into the heads of these fjords
the tongues from the inland ice descend generally to the sea level
and below. The glacier ice is thus directly attacked by the waves
as well as melted in the water, so that it terminates in the fjords
in great cliffs of ice (<a href="#f317">Fig. 317</a>). It is also believed to extend
beneath the water surface as
a long toe resting upon the
bottom (<a href="#f319">Fig. 319</a>).</p>

<p>The exposed cliff is notched
and undercut by the waves in
the same manner as a rock cliff,
and the upper portions override
the lower so that at frequent intervals
small masses of ice from
this front separate on crevasses, and toppling over, fall into the
water with picturesque splashes. Such small bergs, whose birth
may be often seen at the cliff front of both the Greenland and
Alaskan glaciers, have little in common with those great floating
islands of ice that are drifted by the winds until, wasted to a fraction
only of their former proportions, they reach the lanes of transatlantic
travel and become a serious menace to navigation (<a href="#f318">Fig. 318</a>).</p>

from the glacier tongue (after Russell).</p>
</div></div>

<p>Northern icebergs of large dimensions are born either by the lifting
of a separated portion of the extended glacier toe lying upon the
bottom of the fjord, or else they separate bodily from the cliff
itself, apparently where it reaches water sufficiently deep to float it.
In either case the buoyancy of the sea water plays a large rôle in its
separation.</p>

<p>If derived from the submerged glacier toe (<a href="#f319">Fig. 319</a>), a loud noise
is heard before any change is visible, and an instant later the great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
mass of ice rises out of the water some distance away from the
cliff, lifting as it does so a great volume of water which pours off on
all sides in thundering cascades and exposes at last a berg of the
deepest sapphire blue. The commotion produced in the fjord is
prodigious, and a vessel in close proximity is placed in jeopardy.</p>

<p>Even larger bergs are sometimes seen to separate from the ice
cliff, in this case an instant before or simultaneously, with a loud
report, but such bergs float away with comparatively little commotion
in the water.</p>

     <div class="caption"><p class="pc400"><span class="smcap">Fig. 320.</span>&mdash;A northern iceberg surrounded by sea ice.</p>
</div></div>

<p>The icebergs of the south polar region are usually built upon a
far grander scale than those of the Arctic regions, and are, further,
both distinctly tabular in form and bounded by rectangular outlines
(<a href="#f321">Fig. 321</a>). Whereas the large bergs of Greenlandic origin
are of ice and blue in color, the tabular bergs of Antarctica might
better be described as <i>snowbergs</i>, since they are of a blinding whiteness
and their visible portions are either compacted snow or alternating
thick layers of compact snow and thin ribbons of blue ice,
the latter thicker and more abundant toward the base. All such
bergs have been derived from the shelf ice and not from the inland
ice itself. Blue icebergs which have been derived from the inland
ice have been described from the one Antarctic land that has been
explored in which that ice descends directly to the sea.</p>

</div></div>

<p>In both the northern and southern hemispheres those bergs
which have floated into lower latitudes have suffered profound
transformations. Their exposed surfaces have been melted in the
sun, washed by the rain, and battered by the waves, so that they
lose their relatively simple forms but acquire rounded surfaces in
place of the early angular ones (<a href="#f318">Fig. 318</a>, <a href="#Page_291">p.291</a>). Sir John Murray,
who had such extended opportunities of studying the southern icebergs
from the deck of the <i>Challenger</i>, has thus described their
beauties:</p>

<p>“Waves dash, against the vertical faces of the floating ice island as
against a rocky shore, so that at the sea level they are first cut into ledges
and gullies, and then into caves and caverns of the most heavenly blue,
from out of which there comes the resounding roar of the ocean, and into
which the snow-white and other petrels may be seen to wing their way
through guards of soldier-like penguins stationed at the entrances. As
these ice islands are slowly drifted by wind and current to the north, they
tilt, turn and sometimes capsize, and then submerged prongs and spits are
thrown high into the air, producing irregular pinnacled bergs higher, possibly,
than the original table-shaped mass.”</p>

<p class="pch">THE CONTINENTAL GLACIERS OF THE “ICE AGE”</p>

<p><b>Earlier cycles of glaciation.</b>&mdash;Our study of the rocks composing
the outermost shell of the lithosphere tells us that in at least
three widely separated periods of its history the earth has passed
through cycles of glaciation during which considerable portions
of its surface have been submerged beneath continental glaciers.
The latest of these occurred in the yesterday of geology and has
often been referred to as the “ice age”, because until quite recently
it was supposed to be the only one of which a record was
preserved.</p>

</div></div>

<p>This latest ice age represents four complete cycles of glaciation,
for it is believed that the continental ice developed and then
completely disappeared during a period of mild climate before the
next glacier had formed in its place, and that this alternation of
climates was no less than three times repeated, making four cycles
in all. At nearly or quite the same time ice masses developed in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
northern North America and
in northern Europe, the embossments
of the ice domes
being located in Canada and
in Scandinavia respectively
(<a href="#f322">Fig. 322</a>). There appears to
have been at this time no extensive
glaciation of the southern
hemisphere, though in the
next earlier of the known great
periods of glaciation&mdash;the so-called
Permo-Carboniferous&mdash;it was the southern hemisphere, and
not the northern, that was affected (<a href="#f323">Fig. 323</a> and <a href="#f304">Fig. 304</a>, <a href="#Page_276">p.276</a>).
From the still earlier glacial period our data are naturally much
more meager, but it seems probable that it was characterized by
glaciated areas within both the northern and the southern hemispheres.</p>

<p><b>Contrast of the glaciated and nonglaciated regions.</b>&mdash;Since
we have now studied in brief outline the characteristics of the existing
continental glaciers, we are in a position to review the evidences
of former glaciers, the records of which exist in their carvings, their
gravings, and their deposits.</p>

</div></div>

<p>An observant person familiar with the aspects of Nature in both
the northern and southern portions of the central and eastern
United States must have noticed that the general courses of the
Ohio and Missouri rivers define a somewhat marked common border
of areas which in most respects are sharply contrasted  (<a href="#f324">Fig. 324</a>).
Hardly less striking is the contrast between the glaciated and the
nonglaciated regions upon the continent of Europe  (<a href="#f325">Fig. 325</a>).</p>

<p>It is the northern of the two areas which in each case reveals the
characteristic evidences of glaciation, while there is entire absence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
of such marks to the southward of the common border. Within
the American glaciated region there is, however, an area surrounded
like an island, and within this district  (<a href="#f324">Fig. 324</a>) none of the marks
characteristic of glaciation are to be found. This area is usually
referred to as the “driftless area”, and occupies portions of the
states of Wisconsin, Illinois, Minnesota, and Iowa. Even better
than the area to the southward of the Ohio and Missouri rivers, it
permits of a comparison of the nonglaciated with the drift-covered
region.</p>

<p><b>The “driftless area.”</b>&mdash;Within this district, then, we have
preserved for our study a landscape which remains largely as it was
before the several ice
invasions had so profoundly
transformed the
general surface of the
surrounding country.
Speaking broadly, we
may say that it represents
an uplifted and
in part dissected plain,
which to the south and
east particularly reveals
the character of nearly
mature river erosion
(<a href="#f177">Fig. 177</a>, <a href="#Page_170">p. 170</a>). The
rock surface is here
everywhere mantled by
decomposed and disintegrated
rock residues
of local origin. The
soluble constituents of
the rock, such as the
carbonates, have been
removed by the process of leaching, so that the clays no longer
effervesce when treated with dilute mineral acid.</p>

<p>Wherever favored by joints and by an alternation of harder
and softer rock layers, picturesque unstable erosion remnants or
“chimneys” may stand out in relief (<a href="#f326">Fig. 326</a>). Furthermore, the
driftless area is throughout perfectly drained&mdash;it is without lakes
or swamps&mdash;since all valleys are characterized throughout by
forward grades. The side valleys enter the main valleys as do the
branches a tree trunk; in other words, the drainage is described as
arborescent. In so far as any portions of a plane surface now remain
in the landscape, they are found at the highest levels (<a href="#p16a">plate 16 A</a>).
The topography is thus the result of a partial removal by erosion
of an upland and may be described as <i>incised topography</i>. Nowhere
within the area are there found rock masses foreign to the region,
but all mantle rock is the weathered product of the underlying
ledges.</p>

<p><b>Characteristics of the glaciated regions.</b>&mdash;The topography of
the driftless area has been described as <i>incised</i>, because due to the
partial destruction of an uplifted plain; and this surface is, moreover,
perfectly drained. The
characteristic topography of the
“drift” areas is by contrast <i>built
up</i>; that is to say, the features of
the region instead of being <i>carved</i>
out of a plain are the result of
<i>molding</i> by the process of deposition
(plate 16 B). In so far as a
plane is recognizable, it is to be
found not at the highest, but at
the lowest level&mdash;a surface represented largely by swamps and
lakes&mdash;and above this plain rise the characteristic rounded hills
of various types which have been <i>built up</i> through deposition. The
process by which this has been accomplished is one easy to comprehend.
As it invaded the region, the glacier planed away beneath
its marginal zone all weathered mantle rock and deposited the
planings within the hollows of the surface (<a href="#f327">Fig. 327</a>). The
effect has been to flatten out the preëxisting irregularities of the
surface, and to yield at first a gently undulating plain upon which
are many undrained areas and a haphazard system of drainage
(<a href="#f328">Fig. 328</a>). All unstable erosion remnants, such as now are to be
found within the driftless area, were the first to be toppled over by
the invading glacier, and in their place there is left at best only
rounded and polished “shoulders” of hard and unweathered rock&mdash;the
well-known <i>roches moutonnées</i>.</p>

<p><b>The glacier gravings.</b>&mdash;The tools with which the glacier works<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
are never quite evenly edged, and instead of an in all respects
perfect polish upon the rock pavement, there are left furrowings,
gougings, and scratches. Of whatever sort, these scorings indicate
the lines of ice movement and are thus indubitable records
graven upon the rock floor. When mapped over wide areas, a
most interesting picture is presented to our view, and one which
supplements in an important way the studies of existing continental
glaciers (<a href="#f334">Fig. 334</a>, <a href="#Page_308">p.308</a>, and <a href="#f336">Fig. 336</a>, <a href="#Page_312">p. 312</a>).</p>

<p>It has been customary to think of the glacier as everywhere
eroding its bed, although the only warrant for assuming degradation
by flow of the ice is restricted to the marginal zone, since
here only is there an appreciable surface grade likely to induce
flow. Both upon the advance and again during the retreat of a
glacier, all parts of the area overridden must be subjected to this
action. Heretofore pictured in the imagination as enlarged
models of Alpine glaciers, the vast ice mantles were conceived to
have spread out over the country as the result of a kind of viscous
flow like that of molasses poured upon a flat surface in cold
weather. The maximum thickness of the latest American glacier
of the ice age has been assumed to have been perhaps 10,000 feet
near the summit of its dome in central Labrador. From this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
point it was assumed that the ice traveled southward up the
northern slope of the Laurentian divide in Canada, and thence
to the Ohio river, a distance of over 1300 miles. If such a mantle
of ice be represented in its natural proportions in vertical section,
to cover the distance from center to margin we may use a line
six inches in length, and only <sup>1</sup>/<sub>100</sub> of an inch thick. Upon a reduced
scale these proportions are given in <a href="#f329">Fig. 329</a>. Obviously the
force of gravity acting within a viscous mass of such proportions
would be incompetent to effect a transfer of material from the
center to the periphery, even though the thickness should be
doubled or trebled. Yet until the fixed glacial anticyclone above
the glacier had been proven and its efficiency as a broom recognized,
no other hypothesis than that of viscous flow had been
offered in explanation. The inherited conception of a universal
plucking and abrasion on the bed of the glacier is thus made untenable
and can be accepted for the marginal portion only.</p>

<p>Not only do the rock scorings show the lines of ice movement,
but the directions as well may often be read upon the rock. Wherever
there are pronounced irregularities of surface still existing on
the pavement, these are generally found to have gradual slopes
upon the side from which the ice came, and relatively steep falls
upon the lee or “pluck” side. If, however, we consider the irregularities
of smaller size, the unsymmetrical slopes of these protruding
portions of the floor are found to be reversed&mdash;it is the steep slope
which faces the oncoming ice and the flatter slope which is upon the
lee side. Such minor projections upon the floor usually have their
origin in some harder nodule which deflects the abrading tools and
causes them to pass, some on the one side and some upon the other.
By this process a staple-shaped groove comes to surround the
nodule, leaving an unsymmetrical elevated ridge within, which is
steep upon the stoss side and slopes gently away to leeward.</p>

<p><b>Younger records over older&mdash;the glacier palimpsest.</b>&mdash;Many
important historical facts have been recovered from the largely
effaced writing upon ancient palimpsests, or parchments upon
which an earlier record has been intentionally erased to make room<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
for another. In the gravings upon the glacier pavement, earlier
records have been likewise in large part effaced by later, though in
favorable localities the two may be read together. Thus, as an
example, at the great limestone quarries of Sibley, in southeastern
Michigan, the glaciated rock surface wherever stripped of
its drift cover is a smoothly polished and relatively level floor
with striæ which are directed west-northwest. Beneath this general
surface there are, however, a number of elliptical depressions
which have their longer axes directed south-southwest, one
being from twenty-five to thirty feet long and some ten feet in
depth (<a href="#f330">Fig. 330</a>). These boat-shaped depressions are clearly the
remnants of an earlier
more undulating surface
which the latest
glacier has in large
part planed away,
since the bottoms of
the depressions are no
less perfectly glaciated
but have their striæ
directed in general
near the longer axis of
the troughs. Palimpsest-like
there are
here also the records
of more than one
graving.</p>

<p><b>The dispersion of the drift.</b>&mdash;Long before the “ice age” had
been conceived in the minds of Agassiz and his contemporaries,
it had been remarked that scattered over the North German plain
were rounded fragments of rock which could not possibly have been
derived from their own neighborhood but which could be matched
with the great masses of red granite in Sweden well known as the
“Swedish granite.” Buckland, an English geologist, had in 1815
accounted for such “erratic” blocks of his own country, here of
Scotch granite, by calling in the deluge of Noah; but in the late
thirties of the nineteenth century, Sir Charles Lyell, with the results
of English Arctic explorers in mind, claimed that such traveled
blocks had been transported by icebergs emanating from the polar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
regions. A relic of Buckland’s earlier view we have in the word
“diluvium” still occasionally used in Germany for glacier transported
materials; while the term “drift” still remains in common
use to recall Lyell’s iceberg hypothesis, even though the original
meaning of the term has been abandoned. Drift is now a generic
term and refers to all deposits directly or indirectly referable to the
continental glaciers.</p>

<p>In general the place of derivation of the glacial drift may be said
to be some point more distant from and within the former ice margin
at the time
when it was deposited;
in other
words, the dispersion
of the
drift was centrifugal
with reference
to the
glacier.</p>

<p>Wherever
rocks of unusual
and therefore
easily recognizable
character
can be shown to
occur in place
and with but limited
areas, the
dispersion of
such material is
easy to trace.
The areas of red Swedish and Scotch granite have been used to
follow out in a broad way the dispersion of drift over northern
Europe. Within the region of the Great Lakes of North America
are areas of limited size which are occupied by well marked rock
types, so that the journeyings of their fragments with the continental
glacier can be mapped with some care. Upon the northern
shore of Georgian Bay occurs the beautiful jasper conglomerate,
whose bright red pebbles in their white quartz field attract such
general notice. At Ishpeming in the northern peninsula of Michigan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
is found the equally beautiful jaspilite composed of puckered
alternating layers of black hematite and red jasper. On Keweenaw
Peninsula, which protrudes into Lake Superior from its southern
shore, is found that remarkable occurrence of native copper within
a series of igneous rocks of varied types and colors. Fragments
of this copper, some weighing several
hundreds of pounds each and masked
in a coat of green malachite, have under
the name of “drift” or “float” copper
been collected at many localities within
a broad “fan” of dispersal extending
almost to the very limits of glaciation
(<a href="#f331">Fig. 331</a>).</p>

<p>Some miles to the north of Providence
in Rhode Island there is a hill
known as Iron Hill composed in large
part of black magnetite rock, the so-called
Cumberlandite. From this hill
as an apex there has been dispersed a
great quantity of the rock distributed
as a well marked “bowlder train”
within which the size and the frequency
of the dispersed bowlders is in
inverse ratio to the distance from the
parent ledge (<a href="#f332">Fig. 332</a>). Similar
though less perfect trains of bowlders
are found on the lee side of most projecting
masses of resistant rocks within
the area of the drift.</p>

<p>Large bowlders when left upon a
ledge of notably different appearance
easily attract attention, and have been
described as “perched bowlders.” Resting as they sometimes do
upon a relatively small area, they may be nicely balanced and
thus easily given a pendular or rocking motion. Such “rocking
stones” are common enough, especially among the New England
hills (<a href="#p17b">plate 17 B</a>). Many such bowlders have made somewhat
remarkable peregrinations with many interruptions, having been
carried first in one direction by an earlier glacier to be later transported
in wholly different directions at the time of new ice invasions.</p>

<p><b>The diamonds of the drift.</b>&mdash;Of considerable popular, even if
not economic, interest are the diamonds which have been sown
in the drift after long and interrupted journeyings with the ice
from some unknown home far to the northward in the wilderness
of Canada. The first stone to be discovered was taken by workmen
from a well opening near the little town of Eagle in Wisconsin
in the year 1876. Its nature not being known, it remained where
it was found as a curiosity only, and it was not until 1883 that it
was taken to Milwaukee and sold to a jeweler equally ignorant
of its value, and for the merely nominal sum of one dollar. Later
recognized as a diamond of the unusual weight of sixteen carats,
it was sold to the Tiffanys and became the cause of a long litigation
which did not end until the Supreme Court of Wisconsin had
decided that the Milwaukee jeweler, and not the finder, was entitled
to the price of the stone, since he had been ignorant of its
value at the time of purchase.</p>

diamond of six and one half carats, the Milford diamond of six carats, the Oregon
diamond of four carats, and the Burlington diamond of a little over two carats.</p>
</div></div>

<p>An even larger diamond, of twenty-one carats weight, was found
at Kohlsville, and smaller ones at Oregon, Saukville, Burlington,
and Plum Creek in the state of Wisconsin; at Dowagiac in Michigan;
at Milford in Ohio, and in Morgan and Brown counties in
Indiana. The appearance of some of the larger stones in their
natural size and shape may be seen in <a href="#f333">Fig. 333</a>.</p>

<p>While the number of the diamonds sown in the drift is undoubtedly
large, their dispersion is such that it is little likely they
can be profitably recovered. The distribution of the localities at
which stones have thus far been found is set forth upon <a href="#f334">Fig. 334</a>.
Obviously those that have been found are the ones of larger size,
since these only attract attention. In 1893, when the finding of
the Oregon stone drew attention to these denizens of the drift,
the writer prophesied that other stones would occasionally be discovered
under essentially the same conditions, and such discoveries
are certain to continue in the future.</p>

<p><b>Unassorted and assorted drift.</b>&mdash;The drift is of two distinct
types; namely, that deposited directly by the glacier, which is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
without stratification, or unassorted; and that deposited by water
flowing either beneath or from the ice, and this like most fluid deposited
material is assorted or stratified. The unassorted material
is described as <i>till</i>, or sometimes as “bowlder clay”; the assorted
is sand or gravel, sometimes with small included bowlders,
and is described as <i>kame gravel</i>. To recall the parts which both
the glacier and the streams have played in its deposition, all water-deposited
materials in connection with glaciers are called <i>fluvio-glacial</i>.</p>

<div class="floatleft">

     <div class="cf"><p class="ch250"><span class="smcap">Fig. 335.</span>&mdash;Section in coarse till. Note the
range in size of the materials, the lack of
stratification, and the “soled” form of the
bowlders.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Till is, then, characterized by a noteworthy lack of homogeneity,
both as regards the size and the composition of its constituent
parts. As many as twenty
different rock types of varied
textures and colors may sometimes
be found in a single
exposure of this material, and
the entire gamut is run from
the finest rock flour upon the
one hand to bowlders whose
diameter may be measured
in feet (<a href="#f335">Fig. 335</a>).</p>

<p>In contrast with those derived
by ordinary stream
action, the pebbles and
bowlders of the till are faceted
or “soled”, and usually
show striations upon their
faces. If a number of pebbles are examined, some at least are sure
to be found with striations in more than one direction upon a
single facet. As a criterion for the discrimination of the material
this may be an important mark to be made use of to distinguish
in special cases from rock fragments derived by brecciation and
slickensiding and distributed by the torrents of arid and semiarid
regions.</p>

<p>Inasmuch as the capacity of ice for handling large masses is
greater than that of water, assorted drift is in general less coarse,
and, as its name implies, it is also stratified. From ordinary
stream gravels, the kame gravels are distinguished by the form of
their pebbles, which are generally faceted and in some cases<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
striated. In proportion, however, as the materials are much
worked over by the water, the angles between pebble faces become
rounded and the original shapes considerably masked.</p>


<p><b>Features into which the drift is molded.</b>&mdash;Though the preëxisting
valleys were first filled in by drift materials, thus reducing
the accent of the relief, a continuation of the same process resulted
in the superimposition of features of characteristic shapes upon
the imperfectly evened surface of the earlier stages. These
features belong to several different types, according as they were
built up outside of, at and upon, or within the glacier margin.
The extra-marginal deposits are described as <i>outwash plains</i> or
<i>aprons</i>, or sometimes as <i>valley trains</i>; the marginal are either
<i>moraines</i> or <i>kames</i>; while within the border were formed the <i>till
plain</i> or <i>ground moraine</i>, and, locally also, the <i>drumlin</i> and the
<i>esker</i> or <i>os</i>. These characteristic features are with few exceptions
to be found only within the area covered by the latest of the ice
invasions. For the earlier ones, so much time has now elapsed
that the effect of weathering, wash, and stream erosion has been
such that few of the features are recognizable.</p>

<p>Marginal and extra-marginal features are extended in the direction
of the margin or, in other words, perpendicular to the local
ice movement; while the intra-marginal deposits are as noteworthy
for being perpendicular to the margin, or in correspondence
with the direction of local ice movement. Each of these features
possesses characteristic marks in its form, its size, proportions,
surface molding and orientation, as well as in its constituent
materials. It should perhaps be pointed out that the existing
continental glaciers, being in high latitudes, work upon rock materials
which have been subjected to different weathering processes
from those characteristic of temperate latitudes. Moreover, the
melting of the Pleistocene glaciers having taken place in relatively
low latitudes, larger quantities of rock débris were probably released
from the ice during the time of definite climatic changes, and hence
heavier drift accumulations have for both of these reasons resulted.</p>

<p><b>Marginal or “kettle” moraines.</b>&mdash;Wherever for a protracted
period the margin of the glacier was halted, considerable deposits
of drift were built up at the ice margin. These accumulations
form, however, not only about the margin, but upon the ice surface
as well; in part due to materials collected from melting down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
of the surface, and in part by the upturning of ice layers near the
margin (see <i>ante</i>, <a href="#Page_277">p. 277</a>).</p>

(after Leverett).</p>
</div></div>

<p>An important rôle is played by the thaw water which emerges
at the ice margin, especially within the reëntrants or recesses of
the outline. The materials of moraines are, therefore, till with
large local deposits of kame gravel, and these form in a series of
ridges corresponding to the temporary positions of the ice front.
Their width may range from a few rods to a few miles, their height
may reach a hundred feet or more,
and they stretch across the country
for distances of hundreds or even
thousands of miles, looped in arcs
or scallops which are always convex
outward and which meet in sharp
cusps that in a general way point
toward the embossment of the
former glacier (<a href="#f334">Fig. 334</a>, <a href="#Page_308">p. 308</a>, and
<a href="#f336">Fig. 336</a>). These festoons of the
moraines outline the ice lobes of
the latest ice invasion, which in
North America were centered over
the depressions now occupied by the
Laurentian lakes. There was, thus,
a Lake Superior lobe, a Lake Michigan
lobe, etc. With the aid of
these moraine maps we may thus
in imagination picture in broad lines
the frontal contours of the earlier
glaciers. At specially favorable localities
where the ice front has
crossed a deep valley at the edge of
the Driftless Area, we may, even in a rough way, measure the slope
of the ice face. Thus near Devils Lake in southern Wisconsin the
terminal moraine crosses the former valley of the Wisconsin River,
and in so doing has dropped a distance of about four hundred feet
within the distance of a half mile or thereabouts (<a href="#f337">Fig. 337</a>).</p>

<p>The characteristic surface of the marginal moraine is responsible
for the name “kettle” moraine so generally applied to it. The
“kettles” are roughly circular, undrained basins which lie among
hummocks or knobs, so that the surface has often been referred
to as “knob and basin” topography (<a href="#p17c">plate 17 C</a>).</p>

<p><b>Kames.</b>&mdash;Within reëntrants or recesses of the ice margin the
drift deposits were especially heavy, so that high hills of hummocky
surface have been built up, which are described as <i>kames</i>. Most
of the higher drift hills have this origin. They rarely have any
principal extension along a single direction, but are composed in
large part of assorted materials. In contrast with other portions
of the morainal ridges they lack the prominent basins known as
kettles. Other <i>kames</i> are high hills of assorted materials not in
direct association with moraines
and believed to have
been built up beneath glacier
wells or mills (<a href="#Page_278">p. 278</a>).</p>

<p><b>Outwash plains.</b>&mdash;Upon the
outer margin of the moraine
is generally to be found a plain
of glacial “outwash” composed
of sand or gravel deposited
by the braided streams
(<a href="#f308">Fig. 308</a>, <a href="#Page_280">p. 280</a>) flowing from
the glacier margin. Such
plains, while notably flat (<a href="#f338">Fig. 338</a>),
slope gently away from the moraine. Between the outwash
plain and the moraine there is sometimes found a pit, or <i>fosse</i>
(<a href="#f309">Fig. 309</a>, <a href="#Page_281">p. 281</a>), where a part of the ice front was in part buried
in its own outwash (<a href="#f339">Fig. 339</a>).</p>

<p><b>Pitted plains and interlobate moraines.</b>&mdash;Where glacial outwash
is concentrated within a long and narrow reëntrant, separating
glacial lobes, strips of high plain are sometimes built up which
overtop the other glacial deposits of the district. The sand and
gravel which compose such plains have a surface which is pitted by
numerous deep and more or less circular lakes, so that the term
“pitted plain” has been applied to them. The surface of such a
plain steadily rises toward its highest point in the angle between
the ice lobes. Though consisting almost entirely of assorted
materials, and built up largely without the ice margins, such
gently sloping pitted platforms are described as <i>interlobate moraines</i>.
Upon a topographic map the course of such an interlobate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
moraine may often be followed by the belts of small pit
lakes (see <a href="#f336">Fig. 336</a>).</p>

</div></div>

<p><b>Eskers.</b>&mdash;Intra-morainal features, or those developed beneath
the glacier but relatively near its margin, include the “serpentine
kame”, <i>esker</i>, or,
as it is called in
Scandinavia, the <i>os</i>
(plural <i>osar</i>) (<a href="#f340">Fig. 340</a>).
These diminutive
ridges
have a width seldom
exceeding a
few rods, and a
height a few tens
of feet at most, but with slightly sinuous undulations they may be
followed for tens or even hundreds of miles in the general direction
of the local ice movement (<a href="#f341">Fig. 341</a>). They are composed of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
poorly stratified, thick-bedded sands, gravels, and “worked over”
materials, and are believed to have been formed by subglacial
rivers which flowed in tunnels beneath the ice. Inasmuch as the
deposits were piled against the ice walls, the beds were disturbed
at the sides when these walls disappeared,
and the stratification, which
was somewhat arched in the beginning,
has been altered by sliding at both
margins. As already stated, eskers
have not a general distribution within
the glaciated area, but are often found
in great numbers at specially favored
localities. Formed as they are beneath
the ice, it is believed that many have
their materials redistributed so soon as
uncovered at the glacier margin, because
of the vigorous drainage there.
They are thus to be found only at those
favored localities where for some reason
border drainage is less active, or where
the ice ended in a body of water.</p>

<p><b>Drumlins.</b>&mdash;A peculiar type of small
hill likewise found behind the marginal
moraine in certain favored districts has
the form of an inverted boat or canoe,
the long axis of which is parallel to
the direction of ice movement, as is
that of the esker (<a href="#f342">Fig. 342</a>). Unlike
the esker, this type of hill is composed
of till, and from being found in Ireland
it is called a <i>drumlin</i>, the Irish word
meaning a little hill (<a href="#f343">Fig. 343</a>). Drumlins
are usually found in groups more
or less radial and not far behind the
outermost moraine, to which their radiating axes are perpendicular.
The manner of their formation is involved in some uncertainty,
but it is clear that they have been formed beneath the margin of
the glacier, and have been given their shape by the last glacier
which occupied the district.</p>

<p><b>The shelf ice of the ice age.</b>&mdash;Shelf ice, such as we have become
familiar with in Antarctica as a marginal snow-ice terrace floating
upon the sea, no doubt existed during the ice age above the Gulf
of Maine (see <a href="#f324">Fig. 324</a>, <a href="#Page_298">p. 298</a>), and perhaps also over the deep sea
to the westward of Scotland. Though the inland ice probably
covered the North Sea, and upon the American side of the Atlantic
the Long Island Sound, both these basins are so shallow that
the ice must have rested upon the bottom, for neither is of
sufficient depth to entirely submerge one of the higher European
cathedrals.</p>

The only definite features carved from rock are the <i>roches
moutonnées</i>, with their flattened shoulders, while the hillocks upon
moraines and kames, and the drumlins as well, approximate to
the same profile. The esker in its cross sections is much the same,
though its serpentine extension may offer some variety of curvature
when viewed from higher levels.</p>

<p><b>Interference of glaciers with drainage.</b>&mdash;Every advance and
every retreat of a continental glacier has been marked by a complex
series of episodes in the history of every river whose territory
it has invaded. Whenever the valley was entered from the direction
of its divide, the
effect of the advancing
ice front has generally
been to swell
the waters of the river
into floods to which
the present streams
bear little resemblance
(<a href="#f346">Fig. 346</a>). Because
of the excessive melting,
this has been even
more true of the ice
retreat, but here <i>when
the ice front retired up the valley</i> toward the divide. A sufficiently
striking example is furnished by the Wabash, Kaskaskia, Illinois,
and other streams to the southward of the divide which surrounds
the basin of the Great Lakes (<a href="#f347">Fig. 347</a>).</p>

divide of the St. Lawrence basin, which remain to
mark the floods that issued from the latest continental
glacier during its retreat (after Leverett).</p>
</div></div>

<p>Wherever the relief was small there occurred in the immediate
vicinity of the ice front a temporary diversion of the streams by the
parallel moraines, so that the currents tended to parallel the ice
front. This temporary diversion known as “border drainage”
was brought to a close when the partially impounded waters had,
by cutting their way through the moraines, established more permanent
valleys (<a href="#f348">Fig. 348</a>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span></p>


<p><b>Temporary lakes due to ice blocking.</b>&mdash;Whenever, on the contrary,
the advancing ice front entered a valley from the direction
of its mouth, or a <i>retreating
ice front retired
down the valley</i>, quite
different results followed,
since the waters
were now impounded
by the ice front serving
as a dam. Though the
histories of such blocking
of rivers are often
quite complex, the principles
which underlie
them are in reality simple
enough. Of the
lakes formed during advancing
hemicycles of
glaciation, and of all
save the latest receding
hemicycle, no satisfactory
records are preserved,
for the reason
that the lake beaches and the lake deposits were later disturbed
and buried by the overriding ice sheets. We have, however, every
reason to suppose that the histories of each of these hemicycles
were in every way as complex and interesting as that of the one
which we are permitted to study.</p>

principles upon which such lakes are dependent, we shall consider

to explain them, though in vain, was Charles Darwin, the father
of modern evolution. He offered it as his view that the “roads”
were beaches formed at a time when the sea entered the glens
and stood at these levels. When, however, Jamieson’s studies
had discovered their true history, Darwin, with a frankness characteristic
of some of the greatest scientists, admitted how far astray<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
he had been in his reasoning. Let us, then, first examine the facts,
and later their interpretation. The map of <a href="#f350">Fig. 350</a> will suffice
to set forth with sufficient clearness the course of the several
“roads.” These “roads” are found in a number of glens tributary
to Loch Lochy, and of the three neighboring valleys, Glen
Roy has three, Glen Glaster two, and Glen Spean one “road.”
The facts of greatest significance in arriving at their interpretation
relate to their elevations with reference to the passes at the valley
heads, their abrupt terminations down-valleyward, and the morainic
accumulations which are found where they terminate. The
single “road” of Glen Spean is found at an elevation of 898
feet, a height which corresponds to that of the pass or col at the
head of its valley and to the lowest of the “roads” in both Glens
Glaster and Roy. Similarly the upper of the two “roads” in
Glen Glaster is at the height of the pass at its head (1075 feet)
and corresponds in elevation to the middle one of the three “roads”
in Glen Roy. Lastly, the highest of the “roads” in Glen Roy is
found at an elevation of 1151 feet, the height of the col at the head
of the Glen. In the neighboring Glen Gloy is a still higher “road”
corresponding likewise in elevation to that of the pass through
which it connects with Glen Roy.</p>

have three “roads”, two “roads”, and one “road”, respectively (after Jamieson).</p>
</div></div>

<p>To come now to the explanation of the “roads”, it may be said
at the outset that they are, as Darwin supposed, beach terraces
cut by waves, not as he believed of the ocean, but of lakes which
once filled portions of the glens when glaciers proceeding from
Ben Nevis to the southwestward were blocking their lower portions.

<p>To derive the principles underlying this history, it is at once
seen that <i>all changes are initiated by the retirement of the ice front
to such a point that it unblocks for the waters of a lake an outlet that
is lower than the one in service at the time</i>. This is the principle
which explains nearly all episodes of glacial lake history. Thus,
when the ice front had retired so as to open direct connections
between Glen Roy and Glen Glaster, the col at the head of Glen
Roy was abandoned as an outlet, and the waters fell to the level
fixed for Glen Glaster. A still further retirement at last opened
direct connection between Glen Glaster and Glen Spean, so that
the lake common to Glens Glaster and Roy fell to the level of the
col which was the outlet of the Spean valley at the time. This
stage continued until the ice front had retired so far that the waters
drained naturally down the river Spean to Loch Lochy and thence
to the ocean.</p>

<p><b>The glacial Lake Agassiz.</b>&mdash;The grandest of the temporary lakes
referable to blocking by the continental glaciers of the ice age
must be looked for in the largest
valleys that lay within the territory
invaded and <i>which normally
drain toward the retiring ice front</i>.
In North America these rivers are
the Red River of the North in
Minnesota, the Dakotas, and Manitoba;
and the St. Lawrence River
system. To the ice dam which lay
across the Red River valley we
owe the fertility of that vast plain
of lake deposits where is to-day the
most intensive wheat farming of
the northwest (<a href="#f352">Fig. 352</a>). Lakes Winnipeg, Winnipegoosis, and
Manitoba, and the Lake of the Woods, are all that now remain of
this greatest of the glacial lakes, which in honor of the distinguished
founder of the glacial theory has been called Lake Agassiz (<a href="#f353">Fig. 353</a>).
With their natural outlet blocked by the ice in northern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
Manitoba and Keewatin, the waters of the Red were swollen by
melting from the retiring glacier and spread over a vast area before
finding a southern outlet along the course of the present Lake
Traverse and the valley of the Minnesota River. Along this route
there flowed a mighty flood which carved out a broad valley many
times too large for the Minnesota, its present occupant, and this
giant prehistoric river has been called the Warren River (<a href="#f354">Fig. 354</a>).</p>

</div></div>

<p>It is interesting to follow this ancient waterway and to discover
that, like our normal, present-day streams, it was held up in narrows
wherever outcroppings of harder rock had constricted its channel
(<a href="#f355">Fig. 355</a>). The upper end of the Warren River valley is now
occupied by the long and relatively narrow Lakes Traverse and
Big Stone, each the result of blocking by delta deposits where a
tributary stream has emerged into the valley, but this gigantic
channel continues down to and beyond Minneapolis, occupied as
far as Fort Snelling by the
Minnesota River&mdash;a mere
pygmy compared to its predecessor.
To the earnest student
of glacial geology there can be
few sights more impressive than
are obtained by standing at
Fort Snelling, just above the
confluence of the Minnesota
and the Mississippi rivers, and
surveying first the steep and
narrow valley of the Mississippi
above the junction,&mdash;a
stream fitted to its valley for
the simple reason that it has
carved it,&mdash;and then gazing
up and down that broad valley
in which the great Warren River once flowed majestically to the
sea, now the bed of the Minnesota above the Fort and of the Mississippi
below it (<a href="#f356">Fig. 356</a>).</p>

</div></div>

<p>Just as the “parallel roads” of Glen Roy, roads in name only,
are the beaches of earlier glacial lake stages, so in Lake Agassiz
we have parallel beaches of the barrier type which are often roads
in fact as well as in name, and which mark the stages of successive
lakes within this vast basin. The Herman beach, corresponding
to the highest level of the lake, is thus a sharp topographic boundary
between lake deposits and morainal accumulations, and is
further itself a well-marked topographic feature composed of wave-washed
and hence well-drained materials (<a href="#f357">Fig. 357</a>). Farmers of
the district have been quick to realize that these level and slightly
elevated ridges lack the clay which would render them muddy in
the wet seasons, and are thus ideally adapted for roads. They
have in many sections been thus used over long stretches and are
known as the “ridge roads.”</p>

<p><b>Episodes of the glacial lake history within the St. Lawrence
valley.</b>&mdash;Within this great drainage basin it has apparently
been possible to read the records of each stage in the latest lake
history&mdash;complex as this has been. We have only to recall the
lake stages cited from the Scottish glens and remember that each
new stage was begun in a retirement of the glacier front which unblocked
an outlet of lower level than the last. This sequence
might, however, have been varied by a temporary readvance of the
ice, as indeed once occurred in the Huron-Erie lobe of the great
North American glacier.</p>

</div></div>

<p><b>The crescentic lakes of the earlier stages.</b>&mdash;So long as the
glacier covered the entire drainage basin of the St. Lawrence
River system, all water was freely drained away by streams which
flowed <i>away from</i> the ice front (<a href="#f358">Fig. 358</a>). So soon, however,
as at any point the front had retired behind the divide, impounding
of the waters must locally have occurred. Lakes of this type
are to-day to be seen in Greenland and in the southern Andes;
and though upon a diminutive scale, some idea of their aspect may
be obtained from the appearance of the Märjelen Lake of Switzerland,
here blocked by a mountain glacier (<a href="#f446">Fig. 446</a>, <a href="#Page_411">p. 411</a>).<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
Within all areas of small relief, such as
the prairie country surrounding the
present Laurentian lakes, the earlier
and smaller stages of such ice-blocked
lakes are generally crescentic in outline.
This is because a moraine in
most cases forms the land margin of
the lake, and because the ice cliff
upon the opposite border, although
somewhat straightened, as a consequence
of wave-cutting and iceberg
formation, still retains the convex
outlines characteristic of ice lobes
(<a href="#f359">Fig. 359</a>).</p>

<p>Within each of the Great Lake basins a crescentic lake early appeared
at that end of the depression which was first uncovered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
by the glacier: Lake Duluth in the Superior basin, Lake Chicago
in the Michigan basin, and Lake Maumee in the Huron-Erie
basin (<a href="#f360">Fig. 360</a>).</p>

<p>We may now, with profit, trace the successive episodes of the
glacial lake history, considering for the earlier stages those changes
which occurred within the Huron-Erie basin, since, these are in
essential respects like those of the Michigan and Superior basins,
although worked out in greater detail. Lake Chicago must,
however, be brought into consideration, since in all save the earliest
and the later stages, the waters from the Huron-Erie depression
were discharged through the Grand River into this lake and
thence by the so-called “Chicago outlet” into the Mississippi
(<a href="#p20">plate 20 A</a>).</p>


<p><b>The early Lake Maumee.</b>&mdash;The area, outline, and outlet of
this lake are indicated upon <a href="#f360">Fig. 360</a>. Its ancient beaches have
been traced, as well as the water-laid moraine beneath its former
ice cliff; and no observant traveler who should take his way
down the ancient outlet from Fort Wayne, Indiana, past the town
of Huntington, could fail to be impressed by its size, suggesting
as it does the great volume of water which must once have flowed
along it. Now a channel a mile or more in width, its bed for the
twenty-five miles between Fort Wayne and Huntington may be
seen from the tracks of the Wabash Railway as a series of swamps
merely, while at Huntington the Wabash river enters by a young
<span class="font">V</span>-shaped valley at the side, much as the Mississippi emerges into
the old channel of the Warren River at Fort Snelling, Minnesota
(see <a href="#Page_327">p. 327</a>).</p>

<p>The Huron River of southern Michigan, which now discharges
into Lake Erie, then found its lower course blocked by the glacier
and was thus compelled to find a southerly directed channel now
easily followed to the northern horn of the crescent of Lake
Maumee.</p>


<p><b>The later Lake Maumee.</b>&mdash;When the ice lobe had retired its
front sufficiently, an outlet lower than that at Fort Wayne was
uncovered past the city of Imlay, Michigan, into the Grand
River, and thence through Lake Chicago and its outlet into the
Mississippi. This old outlet south of Chicago follows the course
of the present Drainage Canal and the line of the Chicago &amp;
Alton Railway. The traveler journeying southward by train from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
Chicago has thus the opportunity of observing first the beaches
of the former lake, and then the several channels which were
joined in the main outlet at the station of Sag (<a href="#p20">plate 20 A</a>).</p>

<p>In this stage of our history Lake Maumee pushed a shrunk
arm up past the site of Ypsilanti in Michigan (<a href="#f361">Fig. 361</a>), the well-marked
beach being found on Summit Street opposite the State
Normal College. The Huron River, which in the first lake stage
had followed the valley now occupied by the Raisin River southward
into Indiana, now discharged directly into a bay upon this
arm of Lake Maumee, and so formed a delta at Ann Arbor.</p>

(after Leverett).</p>
</div></div>

<p><b>Lakes Arkona and Whittlesey.</b>&mdash;The ice front in the Huron-Erie
basin now retired so far that the impounded waters, instead
of following the more direct “Imlay outlet” to the Grand, passed
at a lower level completely around “the thumb” of Michigan
into the Saginaw basin. Meanwhile a crescent-shaped lake had
developed in that basin, so that now the waters of the Maumee
basin were joined to those in the Saginaw basin as a common
lake, just as the lowering of the waters in Glen Roy caused a
union with those of Glen Glaster in the example cited for illustration.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
Our records of this third North American lake stage,
referred to as Lake Arkona, are however most imperfect, for the
reason that it was followed by a readvance of the ice front which
closed the passage around “the thumb” and raised the level of
the waters until an outlet was found past the town of Ubly at a
lower level than the “Imlay outlet.” When the waters of a
lake are thus rising, strong beach formations result, and those of
this stage, which is known as the Lake Whittlesey stage, are much
the strongest that are found within the Huron-Erie basin. Traced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
for some three hundred miles entirely around the southern and
western margins of Lake Erie, this beach is for much of the distance
the famous “ridge road” (<a href="#f362">Fig. 362</a>).</p>


<p><b>Lake Warren.</b>&mdash;As the ice advance which had produced Lake
Whittlesey came to an end, the normal recession was resumed
and a lake once more formed as a body common to the Saginaw
and Erie basins. This lake, known as Lake Warren, extended
a shrunk arm far eastward along the ice front into western New
York, though it was still blocked from entering the great Mohawk
valley (<a href="#f363">Fig. 363</a>).</p>

<p><b>Lakes Iroquois and Algonquin.</b>&mdash;It must be evident that
toward the close of the Lake Warren stage a profound change was
imminent&mdash;a transfer of the glacial waters from their course to
the Mississippi and the Gulf to the trench which crosses New
York State and enters the Atlantic. So soon as the ice front had
retired sufficiently to lay bare the bed of the Mohawk, an outlet
was found by this route and its continuation down the Hudson
valley to the sea. The Lake Ontario basin now became occupied
by a considerably larger water body known as Lake Iroquois, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
the three upper lakes, then joined as Lake Algonquin, discharged
their combined waters into Lake Iroquois at first through a great
channel now strongly marked across Ontario in the course of the
Trent River and Lake Simcoe, the so-called “Trent outlet.”
At this time a smaller Lake Erie probably occupied the basin of
that lake, and later the Trent outlet was abandoned for the Port
Huron outlet (<a href="#f364">Fig. 364</a>).</p>

Bay into the Champlain Sea.</p>
</div></div>

<p><b>The Nipissing Great Lakes.</b>&mdash;We have now followed the ice
front step by step in its retreat across the valley of the St. Lawrence
system. The successive unblocking of outlets offers but
one further possibility&mdash;the opening of the French River-Nipissing
Lake-Ottawa River, or “North Bay outlet.” Though not
so to-day, the bed of this ancient channel was then much lower
than that of the “Mohawk outlet”, and so soon as the glacier
had in its retreat uncovered this northern channel, the waters of
the upper lakes discharged through it past the site of Ottawa
and into an arm of the sea which then occupied the lower St.
Lawrence valley and has been called the Champlain Gulf or Sea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
(<a href="#f365">Fig. 365</a>). The level of the waters was lowered and the area
of the lakes correspondingly reduced.</p>

<p>The reader who has had no opportunity to observe these ancient
channels which carried the swollen waters of the former
glacier lakes, will find it interesting to consider that every one of
them has been fixed upon by engineers for improvement as artificial
waterways. Thus we have the Illinois Drainage Canal
and projected ship canal along the “Chicago outlet”, the projected
Mississippi-Lake Erie Canal along the “Fort Wayne outlet”,
the Grand River canal project to connect Lake Michigan and
Saginaw Bay along the course of the “Grand River outlet”, the
Trent Canal along the “Trent outlet”, the Erie Canal along the
“Mohawk outlet”, and, lastly, the proposed Georgian Bay ship
canal to the ocean along the “North Bay” or “Nipissing outlet.”</p>

<p><b>Summary of lake stages.</b>&mdash;We have omitted in this summary
of late lake history in the Laurentian basin all the less
important lake stages, including some of a transitional nature
which were represented by beaches and outlets easily traced to-day.
This is because it is an outline only which it seems best to
present, and the episodes of this abridged history may be tabulated
as follows:</p>

<p class="p1"><b>Permanent changes of drainage affected by the glacier.</b>&mdash;While
the lake history which we have sketched is made up of episodes
which endured only while the ice front lay between certain stations
upon its retreat, there were none the less brought about the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
profoundest of permanent modifications in the drainage of the
region. It is possible to restore upon maps in part only the preglacial
drainage of the north central states, but we know at least
that it was as different as may be from that which we find to-day.
The Missouri and the Ohio take their courses to-day along the
margin of the glaciated area as an inheritance from the border
drainage of the ice age. Within the glaciated regions rivers
have in many cases been compelled by morainal obstructions to
enter upon new courses, or even to travel
in the opposite direction along their
former channels. In districts of considerable
relief these diversions have
sometimes caused the streams to plunge
over the walls of deep valleys, and it
may truthfully be said that we owe
much of our most beautiful scenery in
part to the carving and molding of
glaciers, but especially to the cascades
and waterfalls directly due to their interference
with drainage.</p>

drainage of the upper Ohio
region (after Chamberlin and
Leverett).</p>
</div></div>

<p>Many diversions or reversals of former
drainage lines, through the influence of
the continental glacier, are at once suggested
by the abnormal stream courses,
which appear upon our maps, and the
correctness of these suggestions may
often be confirmed by very simple observations
made upon the ground.
The map of <a href="#f366">Fig. 366</a> shows how different
was the preglacial drainage of the upper Ohio region from
that of to-day.</p>

<p>An interesting additional example is furnished by the Still
River which in Connecticut is tributary to the Farmington, and
is no less remarkable for its abnormal northerly course and sluggish
current perpetuated in its name, than for the way in which it is joined
to the Farmington system (<a href="#f367">Fig. 367 <i>A</i></a>). A careful study of the
district has shown that the Still River was once a part of the
Naugatuck and flowed southward toward Long Island Sound like
other rivers of the district (<a href="#f367">Fig. 367 <i>B</i></a>). It possessed, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
an advantage in a narrow belt of softer rock along its course, and
because of this advantage it captured a portion of one of the tributaries
to the Farmington (<a href="#f367">Fig. 367 <i>C</i></a>). The continental glacier
later covered the region, and on its retreat laid down morainal
obstructions directly across this river and also at the head of the
severed arm of the Farmington tributary (<a href="#f367">Fig. 367 <i>D</i></a>). The now
impounded waters found their lowest outlet near Sandy Brook,
and in waterfalls and cascades the now reversed river falls one
hundred feet to the bed of that stream. With the aid of the
excellent topographic maps which are now supplied by a generous
government at a merely nominal price, such bits of recent history
may be read at many places within the glaciated region.</p>

<p><b>Glacial Lake Ojibway in the Hudson Bay drainage basin.</b>&mdash;When
by passing over the “height of land” in northern Ontario
the greatly reduced continental glacier had vacated the basin
of St. Lawrence drainage, it was in a position to impound those
waters which normally drained to Hudson Bay. The lake which
then came into existence has been called Lake Ojibway and was the
latest of the entire series. Though of but recent discovery in
a country till lately a trackless wilderness, its extension seems to
have been that of the clay beds suited for farming. The beaches
and outlets remain to be mapped when the country has been
made more easily accessible.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXIV</h2>

<p class="pch">THE UPTILT OF THE LAND AT THE CLOSE OF THE
ICE AGE</p>

<p><b>The response of the earth’s shell to its ice mantle.</b>&mdash;There
is now good reason to believe that the earth’s outer shell makes
a response by oscillations of level due to the loading by ice, on the
one hand, and to the removal of this burden upon the other. We
know, at least, that both in northern Europe and in North America
areas which have undergone depression during and elevation after
the ice age, correspond closely to the regions which were ice covered.
Wherever in these regions there was high relief before the
advent of the ice, river valleys were drowned at the land margins
and were also gouged out into troughs through erosion by the
outlet tongues upon the margin of the ice sheet. Such furrowed
and half-submerged valleys have a characteristic <span class="font">U</span>-shaped section,
so that their walls rise precipitously from the sea. From
their typical occurrence in Scandinavian countries the name <i>fjord</i>
has been applied to them.</p>

<p>It is now no less clear that the removal of the ice blanket brought
from the earth a relatively quick response in uplift, which began
before the ice front had retired across the present international
boundary of the United States, and that this uplift continued
until the final disappearance of the ice. A far slower elevation of
a somewhat different nature has continued, even to the present
day.</p>

<p>It is obvious that at the time of their formation all shore lines
referable to the work of waves must have been horizontal, and
hence any variations from a perfect level which they reveal to-day
must indicate that a tilting movement of the ground has occurred
since the waters departed from their basins. We have thus
provided for us in the positions of these ancient water planes,
particularly because of their wide extent, a complete record the
refinement of which is not easily overstated. Interpreting this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
record, we find that it was the uptilt of the land to the northward
which brought the glacial lake history to an end and inaugurated
the present system of St. Lawrence drainage. The outlet of the
Nipissing Great Lakes is to-day more than a hundred feet above
the level of the outlet at Port Huron, where the upper lakes are
now discharging their waters, and this difference in level can
only be ascribed to an upward tilting of the land since the latest
of the glacial lake stages.</p>


<p><b>The abandoned strands as they appear to-day.</b>&mdash;The traveler
by steamer upon the upper lakes, as he comes within view of
each rocky headland, may note
how the profile against the horizon
is notched by a series of
steps or terraces (<a href="#f368">Fig. 368</a>),
and if he has followed the discussion
in previous chapters,
he will suspect that these terraces
mark the now abandoned
shore lines which have come
to their present position through a series of uplifts of the ground
accompanied by earthquake shocks. As his steamer skirts the
shore he may chance to note a cave within the rock cliff which
represents the now elevated sea-arch of an ancient shore.</p>

Lake Michigan (after Goldthwait).</p>
</div></div>

<p>Disembarking from the steamer and traveling inland at any
point where the shores are high, the traveler is certain to come
upon still more convincing proofs of the ancient strands; perhaps
in a storm beach of the unmistakable “shingle”, half buried though
it may be under dunes of newly drifted sand, or possibly at higher
levels the highway has been cut through a shingle barrier as
fresh and unmistakable as though formed upon the present shore.
Sometimes it is the rock cliff and terrace, at other times barrier
ridges of shingle, or, again, it is the sloping cliff and terrace cut
in the drift deposits; but of whatever sort, if studied with proper
regard to the topography of the district, the evidence is clear
and unmistakable.</p>


<p><b>The records of uplift about Mackinac Island.</b>&mdash;Nowhere are
the records of the recent uplift of the lake region more easily read
than about Mackinac Island in the straits connecting Lake Michigan
with Lake Huron. Approaching the island by steamer from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
St. Ignace, its profile upon the horizon is worthy of remark (<a href="#f369">Fig. 369</a>).
From a central crest broken by minor irregularities and
bounded on all sides by a cliff, the island profile slopes gently
away to a still lower cliff, below which is another terrace.</p>

</div></div>

<p>When we have reached the island and have climbed to the
summit, we there find the surface which is characteristic of erosion
by running water, whereas at lower levels are found the forms
carved or molded by the action of waves. This central “island”,
superimposed upon the larger island, is all that rose above Lake
Algonquin, the earliest of the glacial lakes in this northern district;
and as we look out from the observatory upon the summit,
it is easy to call up a picture of
the country when the lake stood
at the base of this highest cliff.
To the northward one sees the
“Sugar Loaf” rise out of a sea
of foliage, as it formerly did
from the waters of Lake Algonquin
(<a href="#f370">Fig. 370</a>). It is a huge
stack near the former island
shore. If we turn now to the
southward and direct our gaze
toward the Fort, we encounter
a veritable succession of beach ridges formed of shingle and ranged
like a series of waves within the cleared space of the “Short
Target Range” (<a href="#f371">Fig. 371</a>). These ridges mark each a stage within<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
a series of successive uplifts which have brought the island to
its present height.</p>

<p>If now we descend from our position and visit the “battlefield”,
we find there a great ridge of level crest, behind which
the British force was stationed in its defense of the island in
1812. Near by in the woods is Pulpit Rock, a strikingly perfect
stack of the Nipissing Lake. Across the straits at St. Ignace is an
even finer example of the notched
stack (<a href="#f372">Fig. 372</a>). Other less prominent
beaches, but all later than the
Nipissing Lakes, intervene between
this level and the present shore to
mark the stages in the continued uplift
of the land.</p>

<p><b>The present inclinations of the uplifted
strands.</b>&mdash;It is not enough that
we should have recognized the marks
of former shores now at considerable
elevations above the existing lakes;
if we are to know the nature of the
uplift, we must prepare accurate maps
based upon measurements by precise
leveling at many localities. Such
methods are, however, of comparatively
recent application in this field;
and, as in the investigation of so many
other problems, the earlier observations
were largely of the nature of
reconnaissances with the elevation of
beaches estimated by comparatively
crude methods only. The evolution
of ideas concerning the uptilt has,
therefore, been a gradual one.</p>

</div></div>

<p>It was early observed that the
beaches corresponding to a given lake
stage were higher to the northward
and northeastward, and the natural
conclusion from this was that the
earth’s crust had here been canted
like a trap door (<a href="#f373">Fig. 373, <i>A</i></a>). As we are to see, this but half-correct
assumption has led to a striking prophecy relating to future<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
changes within the lake region which we now know to be without
warrant in the facts. Later it was learned that the uptilt
of the lake beaches is much accelerated to the northward (<a href="#f373">Fig. 373,<i> B</i></a>),
and that new beaches make their appearance from beneath
others as
we proceed in
this direction&mdash;there
is a “feathering
out” of
beaches to the
northward (<a href="#f373">Fig. 373, <i>C</i></a>).</p>

<p><b>The hinge
lines of uptilt.</b>&mdash;Still
later in
the study of the
region, it was
learned that the
axis or fulcrum
about which the
region has been
uptilted, instead
of lying to the
southward of the
lake district, as
had been assumed
by Gilbert, lay within the region and about halfway up
the basin of Lake Michigan (<a href="#f373">Fig. 373, <i>D</i></a>, and <a href="#f374">Fig. 374</a>). Similarly,
in the uptilt which followed the ice retreat in northern
Europe a definite hinge line of movement has been discovered.</p>

<p>Lastly, it has been shown, as a result of the use of precise leveling
methods, that not one but several hinge lines of movement
lie within the region, and that the separate sections into which
they divide the area are each in turn characterized by increased
up-cant as we proceed to the northward (<a href="#f373">Fig. 373, <i>E</i></a>. and <a href="#f374">Fig. 374</a>).</p>

of the crust by uplift in blocks unloaded of the ice in succession. A further and
slower uptilt, added after the completion of the first movement, is brought out in
the last diagram (<i>b</i>´).</p>
</div></div>

<p>The beaches of Lake Maumee, the earliest of the series of lakes
within the Huron-Erie lobe and within the extreme southern
portion of the Great Lakes area, show only the slightest possible
northerly uptilt, and the well-marked hinge line disclosed in the
Whittlesey beach is evidence that the elastic recoil, as it were,
from the weight of the mantling glacier did not begin until after
the draining of Lake Whittlesey. The determination by Taylor
that there is a similar initial hinge line in the Warren beach&mdash;that
this strand begins its uptilt some fifteen miles farther northeast
than does the Whittlesey beach&mdash;is one of the greatest importance
in obtaining a correct idea of the recent uplift; for it
shows that the draining of Lake Whittlesey was followed by
a period of quick uplift and seismic activity, that the stage of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
Lake Warren was one of comparative stability of the land,
and, lastly, that the draining of Lake Warren was followed by a
second period of rapid uplift and earthquake disturbance.
The strongly marked hinge lines, additional to the initial one
indicated for the Algonquin beaches in the profiles by Goldthwait
from the west shore of Lake Michigan, when considered in
the light of this northeasterly migration of the still earlier hinge
line in the southern district, are best explained through the assumption
of a succession of quick recoveries of the crust by uplift,
separated by periods of relative stability, and brought on by
the removal in turn of the ice burden from successive blocks of
the shell which are separated by the several hinge lines (<a href="#f375">Fig. 375</a>).</p>

<p>The elaborate study of erosion in the outlet of Lake Agassiz
had indicated identical interruptions in the up-canting process
for that basin.</p>


<p><b>Future consequences of the continued uptilt within the lake
region.</b>&mdash;One of the most distinguished of American geologists,
Dr. G. K. Gilbert, in order to determine whether the uptilt revealed
by canted beach lines is still in progress, carried out an elaborate
study upon the gauge records preserved at the various gauging
stations about the Great Lakes. Upon the basis of these studies,
he concluded that the uplift continues, that the axes of equal
uplift (isobases) take their course about fifteen degrees north of
west, so that the lines of greatest uptilt should be perpendicular to
this direction, or fifteen degrees east of north. He further believed
that the basin was undergoing an up-cant in the simple manner of
a trap door, the hinge of which lay to the southward of Chicago,
and the study of the gauge records led him to believe that “the
rate of change is such that the two ends of a line one hundred miles
long and lying in a south-southwest direction are relatively displaced
four tenths of a foot in one hundred years.”</p>


<p><b>Gilbert’s prophecy of a future outlet of the Great Lakes to
the Mississippi.</b>&mdash;The <i>natural</i> rock sill, over which the waters
of Lake Chicago once flowed to the Mississippi, is to-day but
eight feet above the common mean level of Lakes Michigan and
Huron, and if the tilting of the lake region were to continue upon
Gilbert’s assumption of a canting plane with the hinge of the
movement to the south of Chicago, a time must come when the
“Chicago outlet” will again come into use and the lakes once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
more drain to the Mississippi and the Gulf. Upon the basis of
his measurements, Gilbert ventured the prophecy that the first
high-water discharge into the Mississippi should occur in from
five hundred to six hundred years, and for continuous discharge
in fifteen hundred years. In twenty-five hundred years Niagara
Falls should at low water stages be dry from this cause, and in
thirty-five hundred years it should have become extinct.</p>

<p>This prophecy, emanating from a high scientific authority and
relating to changes of such profound economic and commercial
importance, has been often quoted and has taken a firm hold upon
the popular imagination. Obviously, it depends upon the now
exploded theory that the lake basin has been canted <i>as a plane</i>
and that the axis of uptilt lies somewhere to the southward of
the lake region, or, in any event, to the southward of the present
Port Huron outlet. We know to-day that instead of being uniformly
distributed over the entire lake region, the uptilting goes
on at a much higher rate within the northern areas, and that
since the early stage of Lake Whittlesey the hinge line of uplift
has been steadily migrating northward with the retreat of the
ice and is now well to the northward of the present outlet. There
is, therefore, no known uptilt of the district which separates
the present from the former Chicago outlet, and there is no apparent
natural cause which should result in the reoccupation of
the old outlet to the Mississippi. The prophecy must be regarded
as one that has been outgrown with the progress of science.</p>


<p><b>Geological evidences of continued uplift.</b>&mdash;It has recently
been claimed, on the basis of a reëxamination of Gilbert’s study
of the lake gauge records, that his methods are open to serious
criticism and that in reality the figures afford no evidence of continued
uplift of the region. However this may be, there are not
lacking geological evidences which do not admit of doubt, and
these are in a striking way confirmatory of the latest conclusions
upon the manner of the recent uplift.</p>

<p>If our conclusions have been correct, the several lake basins
should now be behaving in different ways as regards the changes
upon their shores. If it is true that the lines of greatest uptilt
run north-northeasterly, there should be, speaking broadly, a
“spilling over” of waters upon the south-southwesterly shores
and a laying bare of the north-northeasterly shore terraces of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
basins. This should, however, be true only of basins whose
outlets are to the northeastward of the existing main hinge line
of uptilt. Lake Huron, having its outlet at the southern margin
of its basin, should not have its waters encroaching upon the
southern shore, for the simple reason that any continued uptilt
of the basin can only have the effect of pouring more water through
the outlet. Lake Michigan and Saginaw Bay, which are arms of
the Huron basin, ought, however, to become flooded upon their
southern shores, <i>were it not that the hinge line of uptilt to-day lies
to the northward of the outlet at Port Huron, and, further, that the
two connecting channels still have their beds lower than the sill of
the outlet channel</i>. Now the evidence goes to show that no encroachment
of waters is occurring upon the Chicago shore of Lake
Michigan, and although the shores of Saginaw Bay are so excessively
flat as to reveal slight changes of level by large migrations
of the strand, yet the ancient meander posts fixed by the early
surveys are still found near the water’s edge.</p>


<p><b>Drowning of southwestern shores of Lakes Superior and Erie.</b>&mdash;Within
the basins occupied by Lakes Superior and Erie, a wholly
different condition is found. In each case the outlet is found
to the northeastward (<a href="#f374">Fig. 374</a>, <a href="#Page_345">p. 345</a>), and the northwesterly trend
of the isobases from these outlets is responsible for a continued
elevation from uptilt of the outlets with reference to the western
and southern shores. In consequence, the waters are encroaching
upon these shores, and rivers which there enter the lake are
drowned at their mouths, with the formation of estuaries. Upon
Lake Superior these changes are very marked near Duluth and particularly
in the St. Louis River, within which, since the early treaty
with the Indians, certain rapids have disappeared and submerged
trunks of trees are now found in the channel of the river. As
far east as Ontonagon essentially the same conditions are found.</p>

<p>Upon the shores within the Porcupine Mountain district, the
waters are clearly rising. Here old cedar trees may be seen, in
some cases dead but still upright and standing in from six to eight
inches of water a number of feet out from the present shore,
while others near the shore, but upon the land and still living, are
washed by the waves, and losing their lower bark in consequence.
An old road along the shore has had to be abandoned because of
the encroaching water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span></p>

<p>Upon the opposite or northeastern shore of the lake, on the
other hand, the land is everywhere rising out of the water, and
the waves are now building storm beaches well out upon the wave-cut
terrace. Here the streams, instead of forming estuaries by
drowning, drop down
in rapids to the level
of the lake.</p>

<p>At the southwestern
margin of Lake
Erie there is everywhere
evidence of a
rapid encroachment
by the water. In the
caves of South Bass
Island stalactites,
which must obviously
have formed above
the lake level, are
now permanently submerged.
It is, however, about Sandusky Bay upon the southwest
shore that the most striking observations have been made.
Moseley has collected historical records of the killing of forest
trees through a submergence which was the result of an advance
of the water upon the shores. It seems to be proven from his
studies that the water is now rising in Sandusky Bay at a rate of
about 2.14 feet per century. In <a href="#f376">Fig. 376</a> there is a comparison
of the shores of the inner bay separated by an interval of about
ninety years.</p>

<p class="pch">NIAGARA FALLS A CLOCK OF RECENT GEOLOGICAL
TIME</p>

<p><b>Features in and about the Niagara gorge.</b>&mdash;A striking example
of those permanent alterations of drainage which have
resulted from the presence of the late continental glacier in North
America is to be found in the Niagara gorge between Lakes Erie
and Ontario. With the aid of borings many of the now buried
channels of the region have been followed out, and in a later paragraph
we shall refer to some of the stronger lines of the earlier
drainage system. Before undertaking the study of Niagara history,
it is essential that one become somewhat familiar with the
present topography in and about the Niagara gorge.</p>

<p>Below the present cataract the river flows through a deep gorge
for about seven miles before issuing at the Lewiston Escarpment
(<a href="#f381">Fig. 381</a>, <a href="#Page_355">p. 355</a>). This gorge has been cut in beds of rock sediments
which dip at a gentle angle southward toward Lake Erie.
The capping of the rock series is a compact and relatively resistant
limestone which is known as the Niagara limestone, beneath
which there are alternating beds of shale with thinner limestone
and sandstone. The plain formed by the upper surface of the
limestone capping terminates in the Lewiston Escarpment, which
is transverse to the direction of the gorge and seven miles distant
below the Falls. The depth of the gorge varies markedly, the
above-water portion being represented at the upper end by the
height of the cataract, one hundred and sixty-five feet, while at
its lower end near Lewiston it is twice that amount. Halfway
down the gorge a sharp turn is made at an angle of more than
ninety degrees, and the upstream arm is extended to form a
basin which contains the famous whirlpool. This visible extension
of the upper gorge is continued in a buried channel, the St.
Davids Gorge, which extends to the escarpment, broadening as
it does so in the form of a trumpet. The materials which fill
this earlier channel are notably coarse glacial deposits (<a href="#f389">Fig. 389</a>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span></p>

     <div class="cf"><p class="ch200"><span class="smcap">Fig. 377.</span>&mdash;Ideal cross section
of the Niagara gorge to show
the marginal terrace.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Directly above the whirlpool the Niagara gorge is first contracted,
but almost immediately swells out into the form of a
sausage, which under the name of the Eddy Basin extends to the
constricted channel occupied by the Whirlpool Rapids. This Gorge
of the Whirlpool Rapids extends to and a little above the railroad
bridges, where it again suddenly widens and deepens and with
surprisingly uniform cross section now continues as far as the cataract.
This uppermost section is known as the Upper Great
Gorge. About a mile below the whirlpool
is that remarkable projection into
the gorge from the Canadian wall which
is known as Wintergreen Flats, below
which and nearer the river are Fosters
Flats. Almost throughout its entire
length the Niagara gorge is bordered
on either side by a narrow and gently
incurving terrace eroded below the general
level of the plain and meeting the
gorge in a sharp angle (<a href="#f377">Fig. 377</a>).</p>

<p>The features immediately about the cataract show that the Falls
are to-day in a condition which, so far as we know, has occurred
but once before in their entire history&mdash;the waters of the river
are divided unequally by an island, and for this reason, as we shall
see, the cataract enters over the <i>side wall</i> of the gorge instead of
at its <i>end</i> (<a href="#f381">Fig. 381</a>), although the turning of the channel from this
cause is combined with a bend of the river.</p>

River above the cataract, where water

are still in place (after J. W.
Spencer).</p>
</div></div>

<p><b>The drilling of the gorge.</b>&mdash;There appear to be two important
processes which are responsible
for the recession of the Falls,
the rate of which is determined
largely by the resistance of the
limestone capping and the tenacity
of the looser shale beneath
it. One of the eroding processes
operates from below and undermines
the cap until the unsupported
cornice falls in blocks
to the bottom of the gorge;
the other makes its attack directly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
from above, selecting for the purpose the lines of jointing
of the rock which it widens by solution and corrasion until the
included blocks are in so far separated that they are torn out and
go over the brink of the Falls (<a href="#f378">Fig. 378</a>). This process of overhead
attack in the powerful currents just above a cataract is even
better illustrated by the Falls of St. Anthony near Minneapolis,
which have had a similar history of recession to that of the Niagara
Falls (<a href="#f379">Fig. 379</a>).</p>

</div></div>

<p>The blocks of the capping limestone at Niagara Falls are to
some extent fixed in size by the joint planes present in them, and
as they fall to the bottom of the gorge, they promote or retard the
further recession of the Falls according as they can or cannot be
moved about by the churning currents beneath the cataract. Of
the retarding effect there is an illustration in the accumulation of
the blocks below the American and the intermediate Luna Falls
(<a href="#p23a">plate 23 A</a>), which the weaker currents upon the American side
find too heavy to handle.</p>

section after Gilbert).</p>
</div></div>

<p class="vh">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>The Canadian Fall, with its much greater
power, is an example of the promotion of recession through the
churning about of the blocks at the base of the cataract. We have
here to do with a churn drill which bores its way into the bottom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
of the gorge with increasing radius of rotary motion with each increase
in volume of the falling water. Under this rotary churning
the soft shales are torn out near the bottom and in succession
the harder layers
above until the capping is
reached (<a href="#f380">Fig. 380</a>). The conditions
appear now to be such
that the effective work is
largely concentrated, as it
usually has been, near the
middle of the channel; and
so the gorge recedes with a
margin of the earlier river
bed remaining as a terrace on
either side and extending to
the former river bank (<a href="#f377">Fig. 377</a>).</p>

<p>As must have been noted,
one peculiarity of the operation
of the churn drill beneath
the cataract is that the depth
of the gorge will bear a direct
proportion to its width, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
if the volume of water has varied during the process of recession,
these changes in volume will be registered in the width and also
in the depth of that section of the gorge which was drilled at the
time&mdash;the cross section of the gorge at any place is proportional
to the volume of the water falling in the cataract which produced
it, modified, however, by the competency to handle the joint blocks
of definite size (<a href="#f381">Fig. 381</a>).</p>

</div></div>

<p><b>The present rate of recession.</b>&mdash;There are various sketches,
more or less accurate, made in the early part of the nineteenth
century, and from the later period there are daguerreotypes, photographs,
and maps, which refer especially to the Canadian Fall; and
which, taken together, render possible a comparison of the earlier
with the later brinks. By comparing the earliest with the recent,
views it is seen at a glance that the Falls are receding, and at a
quite appreciable rate (<a href="#f382">Fig. 382</a>). A careful comparison of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
maps made in 1842, 1875, 1886, 1890, and 1905 of the brink of
the Canadian Fall (<a href="#f383">Fig. 383</a>) indicates that for the period covered
the rate of recession has been about five feet per year, and similar
studies made of the
American Fall show that
it has been receding at
the rate of only three
inches per year, or one
twentieth the rate of the
recession of the Canadian
Fall.</p>

of the Canadian Fall, based upon maps of different
dates (after Gilbert).</p>
</div></div>

<p><b>Future extinction of the
American Fall.</b>&mdash;It is
because of this many
times more rapid recession
of the Canadian
Fall that the Niagara
cataract, instead of lying
athwart the gorge, enters
it from its side. The
Canadian Fall is thus in
reality swinging about
the American, and the
time can already be
roughly estimated when
this more effective drilling
tool will have brought
about a capture, so to speak, of the American Fall through the
cutting off of its water supply. It will then be drained and left
literally “high and dry”, an enduring witness to the geological
effect of an island in making an unequal division of the waters for
the work of two cataracts.</p>

<p>As already pointed out, the inefficiency of the American Fall
as an eroding agent is amply attested by the wall of blocks
already appearing above the water below it. The tourist who a
thousand years hence pays a visit to the Niagara cataract, provided
the water flow is allowed to remain as it has been, will find
above this rampart of blocks a bare cliff in part undermined, and
surmounted by a nearly flat table surface which is cut off from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
existing cataract by a higher section of the gorge (<a href="#f384">Fig. 384</a>). It
is quite likely that this table will furnish the most satisfactory
viewpoint of the future cataract of that date.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div></div>

<p><b>The captured Canadian Fall at Wintergreen Flats.</b>&mdash;What we
have predicted for the future of the present American Fall will
be the better understood from the study of a monument to earlier
capture made long before the upper section of the gorge had
been cut or the whirlpool had come into existence. The tables
were then turned, for it was a fall upon the Canadian side of the
gorge that was captured by one upon the American. The locality
is known as Wintergreen Flats, or sometimes as Fosters Flats;
though the first name properly applies to a higher surface near the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
brink of the gorge, and Fosters Flats to a lower plain near the level
of the river (see <a href="#f381">Fig. 381</a>, <a href="#Page_355">p. 355</a>). The peculiar topographic features
at this locality are well brought out in Gilbert’s bird’s-eye
view of the locality (<a href="#f385">Fig. 385</a>); in fact, in some respects better
than they appear to the tourist upon the ground, for the reason
that the abandoned channel and the Flats on the site of the since
undermined island are both heavily forested and so not easy to
include in a single view. For one who has studied the existing
cataract this early monument is full of meaning. Standing, as
one may, upon the very brink of the former cataract, it is easy
to call up in imagination the grandeur of the earlier surroundings
and to hear the thunder of the falling water. A particularly vivid
touch is added when, in digging over the sand about the great
blocks of fallen limestone underneath the brink, one comes upon
the shells of an animal still living in the Niagara River, though only
in the continual spray beneath the cataract.</p>

</div></div>

<p><b>The Whirlpool Basin excavated from the St. Davids Gorge.</b>&mdash;It
has already been pointed out that a rock channel now filled with
glacial deposits extends from the Whirlpool Basin to the edge of
the escarpment at St. Davids (<a href="#f389">Fig. 389</a>, <a href="#Page_363">p. 363</a>). In plan this
buried gorge has a trumpet form, being more than two miles wide
at its mouth and narrowing to the width of the upper gorge before
it has reached the Whirlpool. Near the Whirlpool it has been in
part excavated by Bowman Creek, thus revealing walls that are
well glaciated. Different opinions have been expressed concerning
the origin of this channel, one being that it is the course either of
a preglacial river or one incised between consecutive glacial invasions;
and another that it is a cataract gorge drilled out between
glacial invasions after the manner of the later Niagara gorge. In
either case its contours have been much modified by the later
glacier or glaciers, whose work of planing, polishing, and widening
is revealed in the exposed surfaces; and it is not improbable that
a cataract has receded along the course of an earlier river valley.</p>

<p>As we shall see, there are facts which point rather clearly to an
earlier cataract which ended its life immediately above the present
Whirlpool. When the later Niagara cataract had receded to near
the upper end of the Cove section, or near the present Whirlpool,
the falling water must have been separated from this older channel
and its filling of till deposits by only a thin wall of rock, and this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
must have been constantly weakened as its thickness was further
reduced.</p>

<p>When this weakened dam at last gave way, it must have produced
a debacle grand in the extreme. It is hardly to be conceived
that the “washout” of the ancient channel to form the Whirlpool
Basin could have occupied more than a small fraction of a
day, though it is highly probable that the broken rock partition
below the Whirlpool was not immediately removed entire. The
mandible-like termination of the Eddy Basin immediately above
the Whirlpool has led Taylor to believe that the cataract quickly
reëstablished itself at this point upon the last site of the extinct
St. Davids cataract. If reduced in power for a short interval, as a
result of the obstructions still remaining in the lately broken dam
below the Whirlpool, the remarkable narrowing of the gorge at
this point would be sufficiently accounted for.</p>

<p>Being compelled to turn through more than a right angle after
it enters the Whirlpool Basin, the swift current of the Niagara
River is forced to double upon itself against the opposite bank
and dive below the incoming current before emerging into the
Cove section below the Whirlpool (<a href="#f386">Fig. 386</a>).</p>

<div class="floatleft">

the Niagara Gorge, and the drift bank
which forms the northwest wall (after
Gilbert).</p>
</div></div>

<p>In tearing out the loose deposits which had filled this part of
the buried St. Davids Gorge,
many bowlders of great size
were left which slid down the
slope and in time produced an
armor about the looser deposits
beneath, so as to protect them
and prevent continued excavation.
Thus it is found that the
submerged northwestern wall
of the basin is sheathed with
bowlders large enough to retain
their positions and so stop a
natural process of placer outwashing
upon a gigantic scale
(<a href="#f386">Fig. 386</a>).</p>


<p><b>The shaping of the Lewiston Escarpment.</b>&mdash;To understand
the formation of the Lewiston Escarpment cut in the hard Niagara
limestone, it is necessary to consider the geology of a much larger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
area&mdash;that of the Great Lakes region as a whole. To the north
of the Lakes in Canada is found a most ancient continent which
was in existence when all the area to the southward lay below the
waters of the ocean. In a period still very many times as long
ago as the events we have under discussion, there were laid down
off the shore of this oldland a series of unconsolidated deposits
which, hardened in the course of time, and elevated, are now represented
by the shales, sandstone, and limestone which we find, one
above the other, in the Niagara gorge in the order in which they
were laid down upon the ocean floor. The formations represented
in the gorge are but a part of the entire series, for other higher members
are represented by rocks about Lake Erie and even farther
to the southward. These strata, having been formed upon an outward
sloping sea floor, had a small initial dip to the southward,
and this has been probably increased by subsequent uptilt, including
the latest which we have so recently had under discussion. At
the present time the beds dip southward by an angle of less than
four degrees, or about thirty-five feet in each mile.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span></p>

<p>When the elevation of the land in the vicinity of this shore had
caused a recession of the waters, there was formed a coastal plain
on the borders of the oldland like that which is now found upon
our Atlantic border between the Appalachians and the sea (<a href="#f272">Fig. 272</a>,
<a href="#Page_246">p. 246</a>). The rivers from the oldland cut their way in narrow
trenches across the newland, and because of the harder limestone
formations, their tributaries gradually became diverted from their
earlier courses until they entered the trunk stream nearly at right
angles and produced the type of drainage
network which is called “trellis drainage.”
It is characteristic of this drainage that
few tributaries of the second order will
flow up the natural slope of the beds, but
on the contrary these natural slopes are
followed in the softer rock nearly at right
angles again to the tributaries of the first
order of magnitude (<a href="#f387">Fig. 387</a>). Thus are
produced a series of more or less parallel
escarpments formed in the harder rock and
having at their base a lowland which rises
gradually in the direction of the oldland
until a new escarpment is reached in the
next lower of the hard formations. Such
flat-topped uplands in series with intermediate
lowlands and separated by sharp
escarpments are known as <i>cuestas</i> (see <a href="#Page_246">p. 246</a>),
and the Lewiston Escarpment limits that formed in Niagara
limestone (<a href="#f38">Figs. 387</a> and <a href="#f388">388</a>).</p>

<p><b>Episodes of Niagara’s history and their correlation with those
of the Glacial Lakes.</b>&mdash;Of the early episodes of Niagara’s history,
our knowledge is not as perfect as we could desire, but the later
events are fully and trustworthily recorded. The birth of the
Falls is to be dated at the time when the ice front had here first
retired into what is now Canadian territory, thus for the first time
allowing the waters from the Erie basin to discharge over the Lewiston
Escarpment into the basin of the newly formed Lake Iroquois
(<a href="#f364">Fig. 364</a>, <a href="#Page_334">p. 334</a>). Since the level of Lake Iroquois was far above
that of the present Lake Ontario, the new-born cataract was not
the equivalent in height of the escarpment to-day. The Iroquois<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
waters then bathed all the lower portion of the escarpment, so
that the foot of the Fall was upon the borders of the Lake.</p>

<p>In order to interpret the history of the Niagara gorge, we must
remember that the effective drilling of this gorge was in each stage
dependent mainly upon
the volume of water discharged
from Lake Erie,
a large discharge being
recorded by a channel
drilled both wide and
deep, while that produced
by the discharge
of a smaller volume was
correspondingly narrow
and shallow. To-day
the gorges of large cross
section have, moreover,
a relatively placid surface,
whereas through the
constricted sections the
water of the river is unable
to pass without first
raising its level at the
upper end and under the
head thus produced rushing
through under an increased
velocity. The
best illustration of such a constricted section is the Gorge of the
Whirlpool Rapids.</p>

the Niagara Gorge to show the changes in cross
section in their relations to Niagara history
(based upon a map by Taylor).</p>
</div></div>

<p>Our reading of the history should begin at the site of the present
cataract, since the records of later events are so much the more
complete and legible, and it should ever be our plan to proceed
from the clearly written pages to those half effaced and illegible.</p>

<p>As we have learned, the most abrupt change in the cross section
of the gorge is found a little above the railroad bridges, where the
Upper Great Gorge is joined to the Gorge of the Whirlpool
Rapids (<a href="#f389">Fig. 389</a>). In view of the remarkably uniform cross
section of the Upper Great Gorge, there is no reason to doubt that
it has been drilled throughout under essentially the same volume<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
of water, and that its lower limit marks the position of the former
cataract when the waters from the upper lakes were transferred
from the “North Bay Outlet” into the present or “Port Huron
Outlet” and Lake Erie. As the upper limit of the Gorge of the
Whirlpool Rapids thus corresponds to the closing of the “North
Bay Outlet” and the extinction of the Nipissing Great Lakes,
so its lower limit doubtless corresponds to the opening of that outlet
and the termination of the preceding Algonquin stage; for in the
stage of the Nipissing lakes the water of the upper lakes, as we
have learned, reached the ocean through the northern outlet.</p>

<p>Mr. Frank Taylor, who has given much study to the problem
of Niagaran history, believes that the Middle Great Gorge, comprising
the Eddy Basin and the Cove section, represents the gorge
drilling which occurred during the later stage of Lake Algonquin
after the “Trent Outlet” had been closed and the waters of the
upper lakes had been turned into the Erie Basin.</p>

<p>Summarizing, then, the episodes of the lake and the gorge history
are to be correlated as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="p1"><b>Time measures of the Niagara clock.</b>&mdash;In primitive civilizations
time has sometimes been measured by the lapse necessary
to accomplish a certain task, such, for example, as walking the
distance between two points; and the natural clock of Niagara
has been of this type. But men possess differences in strength
and speed, and the same man is at some times more vigorous than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
at others, and so does not work at a uniform rate. The cataract
of Niagara, charged with the pent-up energy of the waters of all
the Great Lakes, can rush its work as it is clearly unable to do at
times when the greater part of this energy has been diverted.
Units of distance measured along the gorge are therefore too unreliable
for our use, with the unique exception of the stretch from
the railroad bridges to the site of the present cataract, within
which stretch the gorge cross sections are so nearly uniform as to
indicate an approximation to continued application of uniform
energy. This energy we may actually measure in the existing
cataract, and so fix upon a unit of time that can be translated into
years.</p>

<p>In order to secure the normal rate of recession of this Upper
Great Gorge, we should add to the volume of water in the Canadian
Fall that now passing over the American; and for the reason that
the blocks which fall from the cataract cornice and are the tools
of the drilling instrument approximate to a definite size fixed by
their joint planes, the effect of this added energy it is not easy
to estimate. We may be sure, however, that the drilling action
would be somewhat increased by the junction of the two Falls,
and thus are assured that the average rate of recession within the
Upper Great Gorge has been somewhat in excess of the five feet
per year determined by Gilbert for the present Canadian Fall.
The Upper Great Gorge is about two miles in length, and its beginning
may thus be dated near the dawning of the Christian Era.
The Whirlpool Gorge was cut when the ice vacated the North Bay
Outlet in Canada, and still lay as a broad mantle over all northeastern
Canada. For the earlier gorge and lake stages, the time
estimates are hardly more than guesses, and we need not now concern
ourselves with them.</p>

<p><b>The horologe of late glacial time in Scandinavia.</b>&mdash;A glacial
timepiece of somewhat different construction and of greater refinement
has been made use of in Scandinavia to derive the “geochronology
of the last 12,000 years.” Instead of retreating over
the land and impounding the drainage as it did so, the latest continental
glacier of Scandinavia ended below sea level, and as it
retired, its great subglacial river laid down a giant esker known as
the Stockholm Os, which was bordered by a delta and fringed on
either side by water-laid moraines of the block type. These recessional<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
moraines are upon the average less than 1000 feet apart,
and are believed to have each been formed in a single season. The
delta deposits which surround the esker are of thin-banded clay,
and as an additional uppermost band is found outside every moraine,
these bands are also believed to represent each the delta
deposit of a single year. In studies extending over many years,
Baron de Geer, with the aid of a large body of student helpers,
has succeeded in completing a count of moraines and clay layers,
and so in determining the time to be 12,000 years since the ice
front of the latest continental glacier lay across southern Sweden.
The fertility of conception and the thoroughness of execution of
this epoch-making investigation recommend its conclusion to the
scientific reader.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI</h2>

<p class="pch">LAND SCULPTURE BY MOUNTAIN GLACIERS</p>

<p><b>Contrasted sculpturing of continental and mountain glaciers.</b>&mdash;In
discussing in a previous chapter the rock pavement lately uncovered
by the Greenland glacier, we learned that this surface had
been lowered by the processes of plucking and abrasion, the combined
effect of which is always to reduce the irregularities of the
surface, soften its outlines, and from sharply projecting masses to
develop rounded shoulders of rock&mdash;<i>roches moutonnées</i>.</p>

<p>Though the same processes act in much the same manner beneath
mountain glaciers, though here upon all parts of the bed, they are,
in the earlier stages at least, subordinated to a third process more
important than the two acting together. Sculpture by mountain
glaciers, instead of reducing surface irregularities and softening
outlines, increases the accent of the relief and produces the most
sharply rugged topography that is known. In nearly all places
where Alpinists resort for difficult rock climbing, mountain glaciers
are to be seen, or the evidence for their former presence may
be read in unmistakable characters.</p>


<p><b>Wind distribution of the snow which falls in mountains.</b>&mdash;Until
quite recently students of glaciation have concerned themselves
but little with the work of the wind in lifting and redistributing
the snow after it has fallen. We have already seen that,
for the continental glaciers, wind appears to be the chief transporting
agent, if we except the marginal lobes where glacier flow
assumes large importance. In the case of mountain glaciers, also,
we are to find that for the earlier stages particularly wind is of the
first importance as a redistributing agent. In the higher levels
snow is swept up from the ground by all high winds, and does not
find a resting place until it is dropped beneath an eddy in some
irregularity of the surface; and if the inherited surface be relatively<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
smooth, this will be found in most cases upon the lee of the
mountain crest.</p>

<p>In normal cases at least the inherited irregularities of the higher
zones of mountain upland are the gentle depressions which develop
at the heads of streams. These become, then, the sites of snowdrifts
that are augmented in size from year to year, though at
first they melt away in the late summer.</p>

</div></div>

<p><b>The niches which form on snowdrift sites.</b>&mdash;Wherever a drift
is formed, a process is set in operation, the effect of which is to
hollow out and lower the ground beneath it, a process which has
been called <i>nivation</i>. The drift shown in <a href="#f390">Fig. 390</a> was photographed
in late summer at an elevation of some 9000 feet in the
Yellowstone National Park. The very gently sloping surface
surrounding the drift is covered with grass, but within a zone a
few feet in width on the borders of the drift no grass is growing,
and in its place is found a fine brown soil which is fast becoming
the prey of the moving water derived by melting of the drift.
This is explained by the water permeating the crevices of the rock
and being rent by the nightly freezing. Farther from the drift
the ground is dry, and no such action is possible. With each succeeding
spring the augmented drift as it melts carries all finely
comminuted rock material down slopes beneath the snow to emerge
at the lowest margin and be there deposited in the form of a delta.
By the operation of this process of nivation the higher parts of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
drift site are lowered as deposition goes on upon the lower. The
combined effect is thus to produce a <i>niche</i> or faintly etched amphitheater
upon the slope of the mountain (<a href="#f391">Fig. 391</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter">

photograph by G. von Zahn).</p>
</div></div>

<p><b>The augmented snowdrift moves down the valley&mdash;birth of
the glacier.</b>&mdash;In still lower air temperatures the drifts enlarge with
each succeeding year until they endure throughout the summer
season. From this stage on, an increment of snow is left from each
succeeding season. No longer entirely wasted by melting, the
time soon comes when the upper snow layers will by their weight
compress the lower into ice, and the mass will begin to creep down
the slope along the course of the inherited valley. The enlarged
snowdrift which feeds this ice stream is called the <i>névé</i> or <i>firn</i>.</p>

<p>Against the sloping cliff which had been shaped by nivation
at the upper margin of the snowdrift, that snow which is not of
sufficient depth to begin a movement towards the valley separates
from the moving portion, opening as it does so a cleft or crevasse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
parallel to the wall. This crack in the snow is called by its German
name <i>Bergschrund</i> or <i>Randspalte</i>, and may perhaps be referred
to as the marginal crevasse
(<a href="#f392">Fig. 392</a>).</p>

<p><b>The excavation of the glacial
amphitheater or cirque.</b>&mdash;It has
been found that the marginal crevasse
plays a most important rôle
in the sculpture of mountains by
glaciers, for the great amphitheater
which is everywhere the collecting
basin for the nourishment of mountain
glaciers is not an inherited
feature, but the handiwork of the
ice itself. This was the discovery
of Mr. W. D. Johnson, an American
topographer and geologist, who, in
order to solve the problem of the
amphitheater allowed himself to be
lowered into such a crevasse upon
the Mount Lyell glacier of the
Sierra Nevadas in California.</p>

<p>Let down a distance of a hundred and fifty feet, he reached the
bottom of the crack, and in a drizzling rain of thaw water stood
upon a floor composed of rock masses in part dislodged from a wall
which extended some twenty feet upwards upon the cliff side of the
crevasse. It was evident that the warm air of the day produced
the thaw water which was constantly dripping and which filled
every crack and cranny of the rock surface. With the sinking of
the sun below the peaks the sudden chill, so characteristic of the
end of the day in high mountains, causes this water to freeze and
thus rend the rock along its planes of jointing. Broad and thin
plates of ice, loosened by melting at the walls, could be extracted
from the crevices of the rock as mute witnesses to the powerful
stresses developed by this most vigorous of weathering processes.</p>

</div></div>

<p>In short, the rock wall above the glacier, which in its initial
stage was the upper wall of the niche hollowed beneath the snowdrift,
is first steepened and later continually both recessed and
deepened by an intensive frost rending which is in operation at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
the base of the marginal crevasse. The same process does not go
on as rapidly above the surface of the névé for the reason that <i>the
necessary wetting of the rock surface does not there so generally result
from the daily summer thaw</i>.
At the bottom of the marginal
crevasse alone is this condition
fully realized. Intensive frost
action <i>where the rock is wet with
thaw water daily</i> is thus a
fundamental cause, both of the
hollowing of the early drift site
to form the niche, and of the
later enlargement of this niche
into an amphitheater or cirque
when the drift has been transformed
into the névé of a
glacier. Inasmuch as the crevasse
forms where the snow and
ice pull away from the rock
toward the middle of the depression, the cirque wall in its early
stage has the outline of a semicircle. In the Bighorn Mountains
of Wyoming, all stages, from the unmodified valley heads to the
full-formed cirque, may be seen near
one another (<a href="#f393">Fig. 393</a>). It will be
noted that wherever a glacier has
formed, as indicated by the cirque,
there is a series of lakes which have
developed in the valley below (see
<a href="#Page_412">p. 412</a>).</p>

to which the col approximates.</p>
</div></div>

<p><b>Life history of the cirque.</b>&mdash;In its
earliest stage the cirque is more or
less uniformly supplied with snow
from all sides, and so it enlarges by
recession in a manner to retain its
early semicircular outline. In a later
stage a larger proportion of the snow
reaches the cirque at its sides so that
its further enlargement causes it to
broaden and to flatten somewhat that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
part of its outline which represents the head of the valley (<a href="#f389">Fig. 389</a>,
<a href="#Page_364">p. 364</a>). As the territory of the upland is still further invested
by the cirques, their nourishment
becomes still more irregular,
and the circular outline
gives place to a scalloped
border, as the amphitheater
becomes differentiated into
subordinate smaller cirques,
each of which corresponds to a
scallop of the outline (<a href="#f398">Fig. 398</a>
and <a href="#f394">Fig. 394</a>).</p>

<p><b>Grooved and fretted uplands.</b>&mdash;The
partial investment
by cirques of a mountain
upland yields a type of topography
quite unlike that produced
by any other geological
process. The irregularly connected
remnants of the inherited
upland resemble nothing
so much as a layer of dough
from which biscuits have been
cut (<a href="#f395">Fig. 395</a>). The surface as
a whole, furrowed as it is below
the cirques, may be described as a <i>grooved upland</i> (<a href="#p19a">plate 19 A</a>).
A further continuation of the process removes all traces of the
earlier upland, for the cirques intersect from opposite sides and
thus yield palisades of sharp rock pinnacles which rise on precipitous
walls from a terraced floor. This ultimate product of
cirque sculpture by glaciers is called a <i>fretted upland</i> (<a href="#p18a">plate 18 A</a> and <a href="#p19b">19 B</a>).</p>

<p><b>The features carved above the glacier.</b>&mdash;The ranges of pinnacles
carved out by mountain glaciers have become known by
various names of foreign derivation, such as <i>arête</i>, <i>grat</i>, <i>aiguille</i>
mountains, “files of <i>gendarmes</i>”, etc. They may, perhaps, be
best referred to as <i>comb ridges</i>, and according to their position they
are differentiated into main and lateral comb ridges, as will be
clear from the second map of <a href="#p19b">plate 19</a>.</p>

up the snow is steadily diminished, and hence cirque recession is
correspondingly retarded. Cirques which have approached each
other from opposite sides of the ridge until they have become tangent
at one point may, however, still receive nourishment at the
sides and so continue to cut down the intervening rock wall to
form a pass or <i>col</i>. The theoretical curve which results from
this intersection is that
known as the hyperbola,
of which an illustration
is afforded by <a href="#f396">Fig. 396</a>.
An approximation to this
form is clearly furnished
by most of the mountain
passes in glaciated mountain
districts, and a particularly
good illustration
is furnished from the
vicinity of Glacier on the

Railway (<a href="#f397">Fig. 397</a>).</p>

<p>Upon either side of the

<p><b>The features shaped beneath the glacier.</b>&mdash;Those features
which are carved above the glacier&mdash;the comb ridge, the col,
and the horn&mdash;are all shaped as a result of intensive weathering
upon the cirque wall. The shaping at lower levels is accomplished
by processes in operation below the glacier surface, where weathering
is excluded and where plucking and abrasion work together
to tear away and grind off the rock surface. By their joint action
the valley is both deepened and widened, directly to the height of
the glacier surface, and indirectly through undermining as far up
as rock extends. Thus the valley is transformed into one of broad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
and flat bed and precipitous side walls&mdash;the <span class="font">U</span>-shaped section
illustrated by valleys of the Swiss Alps and in fact in all districts
which have been strongly glaciated by mountain glaciers (<a href="#f399">Fig. 399</a>).</p>

<p>As high up in the valley as it has been occupied by the glacier,
the bed is rounded, smoothed, and polished, and marked by the
characteristic glacial scorings or
striæ which point down the valley.
Above the level of the glacier’s
upper surface, on the other
hand, erosion is accomplished
through undermining or sapping,
a process which always leaves
precipitous slopes of ragged surface
made up of the joint planes
on which the fallen blocks have
separated from the cliff. Thus
there is found a sharp line which separates the smoothly rounded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
rock surface below from the jagged and precipitous one above
(<a href="#f400">Fig. 400</a>). Inasmuch as this boundary usually separates the
scalable from the inaccessible slopes above, snow is apt to lodge
at this level and make it strikingly apparent.</p>

<p>If uplift of the land occurs while glaciers occupy the valleys of
mountains, an increased capacity for deepening the valley is imparted
to these ice
streams, and we find,
as a result, a deep
central valley of <span class="font">U</span>
cross section excavated
within a relatively
broad trough
visible above the
shoulder on either side
of the later furrow.
Save only for its
characteristic curves,
such a valley bears
close resemblance to
a mature stream valley
which has been rejuvenated (see <a href="#Page_173">p. 173</a>). The remnants of the
earlier glacier-carved valley are, as already stated, gently curving
high terraces so common in Switzerland, where they are known as
<i>albs</i> or high mountain meadows. These albs may be seen to special
advantage on the sides of the Chamonix valley (<a href="#f401">Fig. 401</a>), the
Lauterbrunnen valley, or in fact almost any of the larger Alpine
valleys.</p>


<p><b>The cascade stairway in glacier-carved valleys.</b>&mdash;If now, instead
of giving our attention to the cross section, we follow the course
of the valley that has been occupied by a glacier, we find that it
descends by a series of steps or terraces having many backwardly
directed treads (<a href="#p19a">plate 19</a>), whereas a normal and well-established
river valley has only forward grades. Because of these backward
grades the stream waters are impounded, and so lakes
are found strung along the valley in chains as the larger beads
are found in a rosary, and these are the characteristic <i>rock basin
lakes</i> sometimes referred to as “Paternoster Lakes” (see <a href="#Page_412">p. 412</a>
and <a href="#f402">Fig. 402</a>).</p>

<p>When the backward grades upon the valley floor are especially
steep, the rock step becomes a <i>rock bar</i>, or <i>Riegel</i>, of which nearly
every Alpine valley has its examples. In a walk from the Grimsel
to Meiringen many such bars are passed. Carrying in suspension
the sharp rock sand from the glacier deposits along its bed, the
stream which succeeds to the glacier as it vacates its valley saws
its way through these obstructions with a rapidity that is amazing,
thus producing narrow defiles, of which the Gorge of the Aar near
Meiringen and that of the Gorner near Zermatt are such well-known
examples (<a href="#f403">Fig. 403</a>).</p>

<p>It is characteristic of rivers that the tributaries cut their valleys
more rapidly than does the main stream within the neighboring
section, though they cannot cut lower than their outlets&mdash;the
side streams enter <i>accordantly</i>. This is easily explained because
the grades of the tributary streams are the steeper, and, as
we well know, the corrosion of a valley is augmented at a most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
amazing rate for each increase of its grade. No such law controls
the processes of plucking and abrasion by which the glacier lowers
its floor, for these processes
appear to depend for their
efficiency upon the depth of
the ice, and the supply of
cutting tools, quite as much
as upon the grade of the
bed. To apply a homely
illustration, the hollowing
of flagstones upon our walks
is dependent more upon the
number of persons that pass
over them, and upon their
size and the number of protruding
nails in their boot
heels, than upon the grades
upon which they are placed.
At all events we find that
the main glacier valleys are
cut deeper than the side
valleys, so that the latter
become <i>hanging valleys</i>&mdash;they
enter the main valley,
not upon its bed, but some
distance above it (<a href="#f404">Fig. 404</a>).</p>

<p>The <span class="font">U</span>-shaped hanging valleys, like the main valley, are much
too large for the
streams which now fill
them, and these diminutive
side streams
plunge over the steep
wall of the main valley
in ribbon-like falls so
thin that the wind
turns them aside and
disperses the water in
the spray of a “bridal
veil.” Such falls are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
found by the hundred in every glaciated mountain district, imparting
to it one of the greatest of its scenic charms.</p>

<p><b>The character profiles which result from sculpture by mountain
glaciers.</b>&mdash;The lines which are repeated in landscapes carved by
mountain glaciers are easy to recognize (<a href="#f405">Fig. 405</a>). The highest
horizon lines are the outlines of horns which are separated by cols.
Minaret-like palisades, or “files of <i>gendarmes</i>”, often run for long
distances as the characteristic comb ridges. Lower down and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>

distinctness the <span class="font">U</span>-valley, either with or without the albs to show
that the sculpturing process has been interrupted by uplift.</p>

or “beehive” mountains.</p>
</div></div>

<p><b>The sculpture accomplished by ice caps.</b>&mdash;In the case of ice
caps, the only rock exposed is found in the neighborhood of the
margin&mdash;the projecting islands known as nunataks. It is essential
for the existence of the ice cap that the rock base should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
have relatively slight irregularities compared to the dimensions of
the cap itself. Except in very high latitudes this base must be
somewhat elevated, for like mountain glaciers ice caps are nourished
by the surface air currents, and their snows are deposited
above the snow line.</p>

<p><b>The Norwegian tind or beehive mountain.</b>&mdash;Within temperate
or tropical climes the snow line lies so high that only the loftier
mountains are able to support glaciers. It follows that those
which are formed flow upon relatively high grades with correspondingly
high rate of movement and increased cutting power.
Within high latitudes the snow is found nearer the sea level, and
glaciers are for the most part correspondingly sluggish in their
movements as well as less active denuding agents.</p>

<p>To this condition characteristic of high latitude glaciers, there
is added in Norway another in the peculiar shape of the basement
beneath the recent and the still existing glaciers. The plateau of
Norway is intersected by a network of deep and steep walled fjords,
and the glaciers have developed as small ice caps perched upon
veritable pedestals of rock, over the margins of which their outlet
tongues of ice descend on steep slopes into the fjord. The tops
of the pedestals thus come to be shaped by the plucking and abrading
processes into flat domes (<a href="#f406">Fig. 406</a>), while the knobs of rock,
which as nunataks reach above the surface of the ice, divide the
outflowing ice tongues at the margin of the pedestal. These
tongues being much more active denuding agents, because of their
steep gradients, continually lower their beds, thus transforming
the earlier knobs of rock into high and steep mountains of more or
less circular base. Such “beehive” mountains upon the margins
of the fjords are the characteristic Norwegian <i>tinds</i> (<a href="#f407">Fig. 407</a>).</p>

<p class="pch">SUCCESSIVE GLACIER TYPES OF A WANING
GLACIATION</p>

<p><b>Transition from the ice cap to the mountain glacier.</b>&mdash;A study
of existing glaciers leads inevitably to the conclusion that although
subject to short period advances and retreats, yet, broadly speaking,
glaciers are now gradually wasting away, surrounded by wide
areas upon which are the evidences of their recent occupation.
We are thus living in a receding hemicycle of glaciation.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-460.jpg" width="400" height="388" id="f408"

     <div class="caption"><p class="pc400"><span class="smcap">Fig. 408.</span>&mdash;Schematic diagram to show the relationships of glacier types formed
in succession during a receding hemicycle of glaciation.</p>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span></p>

<p>Many mountain districts which now support small glaciers only,
or none at all, were once nearly or quite submerged beneath snow
and ice. If once covered by an ice carapace or cap, our present
interest in them begins at that stage of the receding hemicycle
<i>when the rock surface has made its reappearance above the surface
of the snow-ice mass</i>. At this stage intensive frostwork, the characteristic
high level weathering, begins, and cirques develop above
the scars of those earlier amphitheaters formed in the advancing
hemicycle.</p>


<p><b>The piedmont glacier.</b>&mdash;In this early stage of transition from
the ice cap to the mountain glacier, the ice flows outward to the
mountain front in ill-defined streams divided by the projecting
ridges, and upon reaching the mountain front these streams deploy
upon it so as to coalesce in a great stagnant ice apron whose upper
surface slopes gently forward at an angle of a few degrees at the
most (<a href="#f408">Fig. 408</a>, stage I). This is the <i>piedmont glacier</i>, a type
found to-day in the high latitudes of Alaska and in the southern
Andes (<a href="#f409">Fig. 409</a> and <a href="#p18b">pl. 18 B</a>).</p>

piedmont glaciers (after Russell).</p>
</div></div>

<p>During this stage the cirques may be but poorly defined, and
ice flows in both directions from rock divides so that the streams
transect the range, and later, after the glaciers have disappeared,
may expose a pass smoothed and polished upon its floor and with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
striæ directed in opposite directions from the highest point. The
pass of the Grimsel in Switzerland furnishes an excellent illustration

</div></div>

<p><b>The expanded-foot glacier.</b>&mdash;As air temperatures continue to become
milder, the glacier streams within the mountains are less deep
and hence more clearly
defined, and instead of
coalescing upon the mountain
foreland, they now
issue from the mountains
to form individual aprons
and are described as <i>expanded-foot
glaciers</i> (<a href="#f408">Fig. 408</a>,

</div></div>

<p><b>The dendritic glacier.</b>&mdash;Still
later in the hemicycle nourishment of the glaciers is diminished
as depletion from melting increases, so that the glacier
streams no longer reach to the mountain front. Branches continue
to enter the main valley from
the several side valleys like the short
branches of a tall tree, and because of
this arrangement such a glacier may
be described as a <i>dendritic glacier</i>
(<a href="#f408">Fig. 408</a>, stage III, and <a href="#f410">Fig. 410</a>).</p>

<p>Inasmuch as the depletion from
melting increases at a rapid rate in
descending to lower levels, the tributary
glacier valleys “hanging” above
the main valley in the lower stretches
become separated, and may continue
to exist as series of hanging glacierets
upon either side of the main valley below
the glacier front (<a href="#f408">Fig. 408</a>, stage
III, and <a href="#f411">Fig. 411</a>). It must be clear
from this that any attempt to name
each separated ice stream without
regard to its relationship must lead
to endless confusion, for glacier size<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
is in such sensitive adjustment to air temperature that a fall or rise
of a few degrees only in the average annual temperature of the district
may prove sufficient to fuse many glaciers into one or separate
one ice mass into many smaller ones.</p>

<p>When in high latitudes a dendritic glacier descends in fjords
to below the level of the sea, it is attacked by the water in the same
manner as are the outlets of Greenland glaciers, and is then known
as a “tidewater glacier”,
which may thus be a
subtype or variety of the
dendritic glacier (<a href="#f412">Fig. 412</a>).</p>

<p><b>The radiating (Alpine)
glacier.</b>&mdash;In the progressive
wastings of
dendritic glaciers, there
comes a time when their
dendritic outlines give
place to radiating ones. Attention has already been called to the
division of the cirque into subordinate basins separated by small
rock arêtes and yielding a markedly scalloped border (<a href="#f394">Fig. 394</a>,
<a href="#Page_371">p. 371</a>). When the ice front retires from the main valley into one
of these mature cirques, the now wasted ice stream is broken up
into subordinate glacierets, each of which occupies one of the
basins within the larger cirque, and these ice streams
flow together to produce a glacier whose component
elements radiate like the sticks within a lady’s
fan (<a href="#f408">Fig. 408</a>, stage IV, and <a href="#f413">Fig. 413</a>).</p>

</div></div>

<p><b>The horseshoe glacier.</b>&mdash;As the glacier draws
near to its final extinction, it is crowded hard
against the wall of the amphitheater in which it
has so long been nourished. Up to this stage it
has offered a swelling front outwardly convex as a
direct consequence of the laws controlling its flow.
No longer amply nourished, for the first time its
front is hollowed, and it awaits its final dissolution
curled up against the cirque wall (<a href="#f408">Fig. 408</a>,
stage V, and <a href="#f414">Fig. 414</a>). Practically all the glaciers of the United
States and southern Canada are of this type.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span></p>

<p>The above classification is one depending directly upon glacier
nourishment, and hence also upon size, and upon the stage of the
glacial hemicycle. In order to determine the type of any glacier
it is necessary to know the outlines of the mountain valley&mdash;its
divide&mdash;and those of the glacier or glaciers within it. It
is likely that the types of the advancing hemicycle of glaciation
would be much the same, save only for the <i>new-born</i> or <i>nivation
glacier</i>, which would be as different as possible from the horseshoe
type, to which in size it corresponds. Upon the continent
of Antarctica, where the absence of any general melting of the ice,
even in the summer season and near the sea level, introduces special
conditions, some additional glacier types are found, which, however,
it is not necessary that we consider here.</p>

<p><b>The inherited-basin glacier.</b>&mdash;It may be, however, that glaciers
have developed, not upon mountains shaped in a cycle of
river erosion, nor yet in succession to an ice cap, as in the normal
cases which we have considered. On the contrary, glaciers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
may develop where basins of one sort or another have been
inherited from the preceding period. In such cases inherited depressions
may become more important than the auto-sculpture of
the glacier. Glaciers which develop under such conditions may
be described as <i>inherited-basin glaciers</i>.</p>

<p>A partly closed basin between ridges may supply a collecting
ground for snows carried from neighboring slopes by the wind,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
and so may yield a broad névé, approaching in size a small ice cap,
yet without developing definite ice streams except upon its border.
Such a glacier is the Illecillewaet glacier of the Selkirks (<a href="#f415">Fig. 415</a>).</p>

<p>Again in low latitudes the high and pointed volcanic peaks
may push up beyond the snow line into the upper atmosphere,
and so become snow-capped. Definite cirques do not develop well
under these circumstances, and the loose materials of which such
peaks are always composed are attacked in somewhat irregular
fashion from the different sides. This is the case of Mount Rainier
and similar peaks of the Cascade range of North America.</p>

<p class="pch">THE GLACIER’S SURFACE FEATURES AND THE
DEPOSITS UPON ITS BED</p>

<p><b>The glacier flow.</b>&mdash;The downward flow of the ice within a
mountain glacier has been the subject of many investigations and
the topic of many heated discussions since the time when Louis
Agassiz and his companions set a line of stakes across the Aar
glacier and numbered the surface bowlders in
preparation for repeated observations. Their
first observation was that the line of stakes,
which had run straight across the glacier, was
distorted into a curve which was convex downstream
(<a href="#f416">Fig. 416</a>, A´), thus showing that the
surface layers have more rapid motion in proportion
as they are distant from the side margins.
Summarizing these and later studies, it
may be stated that the glacier increases its rate
of motion from its side margin towards its center
line, from its bed upwards towards its surface,
and below the névé the velocity is greatest
where the fall is greatest and also wherever the
cross section diminishes. In all these particulars,
then, the ice of the glacier behaves like a
stream of water. The average rate of flow of
Alpine glaciers varies from a few inches to a few
feet per day, and is greater during the warm
summer season. The Muir glacier of Alaska
has been shown to move at the rate of about
seven feet per day.</p>

<i>r´</i>, diagonal crevasses.</p>
</div></div>

<p>In traveling from the névé downward to the
glacier foot, the snow not only changes into
ice, but it undergoes a granulating process with continued increase
in the size of the nodules until at the foot of the glacier these may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
be picked out of the partially melted ice as articulating balls the
size of the fist or larger. Glacier ice has therefore a structure
quite different from that of lake ice, since the latter is developed
in parallel needles perpendicular to the freezing surface.</p>


<p><b>Crevasses and séracs.</b>&mdash;Prominent surface indications of glacier
movement are found in the open cracks or <i>crevasses</i>, which
are the marks of its yielding to tensional stresses. Crevasses
are apt to run either directly across the glacier, wherever there is
a steep descent upon its bed, or diagonally, running in from the
margin and directed up-glacier (<i>r</i>, <i>r</i>, <i>r</i>, of <a href="#f416">Fig. 416</a>), though they
occasionally run longitudinally with the glacier when there is
a rock terrace at the side of the valley beneath the ice. The
diagonal crevasses at the glacier margin are due to the more
sluggish movement where the ice is held back by friction upon the
walls of the valley, as will be clear from <a href="#f416">Fig. 416</a>. The square <i>a</i>
has by this movement been distorted into the lozenge <i>a´</i>, so that
the line <i>xy</i> has been extended into <i>x´y´</i>, with the obvious tendency
to open cracks in the direction <i>ss</i>.</p>

<p>Every glacier surface below its névé is marked by steps or
terraces, which are well understood to overlie corresponding steps
of the cascade stairway to be seen in all vacated glacier valleys
(<a href="#p19a">plate 19</a>). The steep risers of these steps are usually marked
by parallel crevasses which cross the glacier. Under the rays
of the sun, which strike them more from one side than from
the other, the slices into which the ice
is divided are transformed into sharpened
blades and needles which are
known as <i>séracs</i> (<a href="#f401">Fig. 401</a>, <a href="#Page_376">p. 376</a>, and
<a href="#f417">Fig. 417</a>).</p>

</div></div>

<p>The numerous crevasses tell us that
the ice is many times wrenched apart
during its journey down the glacier.
This has been illustrated by somewhat
grewsome incidents connected with accidents to Alpinists,
but as they illustrate in some measure both the mode and the rate
of motion of Swiss glaciers, they are worthy of our consideration.</p>


<p><b>Bodies given up by the Glacier <i>des Bossons</i>.</b>&mdash;In the year
1820, during one of the earlier ascents of Mont Blanc, three guides
were buried beneath an avalanche near the <i>Rochers Rouges</i> in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
the névé of the Glacier des Bossons (<a href="#f418">Fig. 418</a>). In 1858 Dr.
Forbes, who had measured the rate of flow of a number of Alpine
glaciers, predicted that the bodies of the victims of this accident
would be given up by the glacier after being entombed from thirty-five
to forty years. In the year 1861, or forty-one years after the
disaster, the heads of the three guides, separated from their bodies,
with some hands and fragments of clothing, appeared at the foot
of the Glacier des Bossons, and in such a state of preservation that
they were easily recognized by a guide who had known them in
life. Inasmuch as these fragments of the bodies had required
forty-one years to travel in the ice the three thousand meters
which separate the place of the accident from the foot of the
glacier, the rate of movement was twenty centimeters, or eight
inches, per day.</p>

<p>Various separated parts of the body of Captain Arkwright, who
had been lost in 1866 upon the névé of the same glacier, reappeared
at its foot after entombment in the ice for a period of thirty-one
years. To-day the time of reappearance of portions of the
bodies of persons lost upon Mont Blanc is rather accurately predicted,
so that friends repair to Chamonix to await the giving up
of its victims by the Glacier des Bossons.</p>

moraines of the <i>Mer de glace</i>
and its tributary ice streams.</p>
</div></div>

<p><b>The moraines.</b>&mdash;The horns and comb ridges which rise above
the glacier surface are continually subject to frost weathering,
and from time to time drop their separated fragments upon the
glacier. Falling as these do from considerable heights, they reach
the ice under a high velocity, and rebounding, sometimes travel
well out upon its surface before coming to a temporary rest. Upon
a fresh snow surface of the névé their tracks may sometimes be
followed with the eye for considerable distances, and their fall
is a constant menace to Alpine climbers. Below the névé the
larger number of such fragments
remain near the
cliff, and the lines of flow
of the ice within the glacier
surface are such that
blocks which reach points
farther out upon the glacier
are later gathered in
beneath the cliff at the side (<a href="#f419">Fig. 419</a>). The ridge of angular rock
débris which thus forms at the side of the glacier is called a
<i>lateral moraine</i> (see <a href="#f411">Fig. 411</a>, <a href="#Page_385">p. 385</a>, and <a href="#f420">Fig. 420</a>).</p>

<p>At the junction of two glacier
streams, the lateral moraines are joined,
and there move out upon the ice surface
of the resultant glacier as a <i>medial
moraine</i>. Thus from the number of
medial moraines upon a glacier surface
it is possible to say that the important
tributary glaciers number one
more (<a href="#f420">Fig. 420</a>).</p>

<p>The plucking and abrading processes
in operation beneath the glacier, quarry
the rock upon its bed, and after shaping
and smoothing the separated rock
fragments, these are incorporated within
the lower layers of the ice as <i>englacial</i>
rock débris. In spaces favorable
for its accumulation, a portion of this material, together with much
finer débris and rock flour, is left behind as a ground moraine
upon the bed of the glacier (see <a href="#f421">Fig. 421</a>).</p>

<p>At the foot of the glacier the relatively angular rock débris,
which has been carried upon the surface, and the soled and polished

<p><b>Selective melting upon the glacier surface.</b>&mdash;The white surface
of the glacier generally reflects a large proportion of the sun’s
rays which reach it, and its more rapid melting is largely accomplished
through the agency of rock fragments spread upon its
surface. Such fragments, however, promote or retard the melting
process in inverse proportion to their size up to a certain limit,
and above that size their action is always to protect the glacier
from the sun. This nice adjustment to the size of the rock fragments
will be clear from examination of <a href="#f422">Fig. 422</a>, for rock is a
poor conductor of heat, and in even the longest summer day a
thin outer layer only is appreciably
warmed. Large rock blocks,
grouped in the medial and lateral
moraines, hold back the process of
lowering the glacier surface during
the summer, so that late in the
season these moraines stand fifty
feet or more above the glacier as
armored ice ridges.</p>

</div></div>

<p>Isolated and large rock slabs, as
the season advances, may come to
form the capping of an ice pedestal
which they overhang and are known
as <i>glacier tables</i> (<a href="#f423">Fig. 423</a>). Such
tables the sun attacks more upon one side than upon the other,
so that the slab inclines more and more to the south and may
eventually slip down until its edges rest against the glacier surface.
Rounded bowlders, which less frequently become perched
upon ice pedestals, may, from a similar process, slide down upon
the southern side and leave a pyramid of ice furrowed upon this
side and known as an <i>ice pyramid</i>.</p>

<p>Fine dirt when scattered over the glacier surface is, on the other
hand, most effective in lowering its level by melting. Use was
made of this knowledge to lower the great drifts of snow which
had to be removed each season during the construction of the
new Bergen railway of southern Norway. Each dirt particle,
being warmed throughout by the sun’s rays, melts its way rapidly
into the glacier surface until the <i>dust well</i> which it has formed is
so deep that the slanting rays of the sun no longer reach it. When
the dirt particles are near together, the thin walls which separate
the dust wells are attacked from the sides in the warm air of summer
days, thus producing from a patch of dirt upon the glacier
surface a <i>bath tub</i> (<a href="#f424">Fig. 424 <i>d</i></a>). At night the water which fills these
basins is frozen to form a lining of ice needles projecting inward
from the wall, and this, repeated in succeeding nights, may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
entirely close the basin with water ice and produce the familiar
<i>glacier star</i> (<a href="#f424">Fig. 424 <i>c</i></a>).</p>

</div></div>

<p>If the dirt upon the glacier surface, instead of being scattered,
is so disposed as to make a patch completely covering the ice to
the thickness of an inch or more, the effect is altogether different.
Protecting as it now does the ice below, a local ice hillock rises
upon its site as the surrounding surface is lowered, and as this
grows in height its declivities increase and a portion of the dirt
slides down the side. The final product of this shaping is an
almost perfectly conical ice hill encased in dirt and known as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>
<i>débris</i>, <i>sand</i>, or <i>dirt cone</i> (<a href="#f425">Fig. 425</a>). The novice in glacier study
is apt to assume that these black cones contain only dirt, but is
rudely awakened to the reality when he attempts to kick them to
pieces. Both glacier tubs and débris cones may assume large
dimensions; as, for example, in Alaska, where they may be properly
described as lakes and hills.</p>

<p>A patch of hard and dense snow which is less easily melted
than that upon which it rests may lead to the formation of snow
cones upon the glacier surface similar in size and shape to the
better known débris cones. Such cones of snow have, with
doubtful propriety, been designated “penitents”, for it is pretty
clear that the interesting bowed snow figures, which really resemble
penitents and which were first described from the southern
Andes under the name of <i>nieves penitentes</i>, are of somewhat different
character.</p>

<p>One further ice feature shaped by differential melting around
rock particles remains to be mentioned. Wherever the seasonal
snowfalls of the névé are exposed in crevasses, they are generally
found to be separated by layers of dirt, and lines of pebbles similarly
separate those ice layers which are revealed at the foot
of the glacier. In either case, if the sun’s rays can reach these
layers in an opened crevasse, the half-buried
rock fragments are warmed by the sun upon
their exposed surfaces and slowly melt their
way down the ice surface, thus removing from
it a thin layer of snow or ice and causing that
part above the pebble layer to project like
a cornice. This process will go on until the
overhanging cornice protects the pebbles from
any further warming by the sun, but each
lower pebble layer that is reached by the sun
will produce an additional cornice, so that
the original surface may at the bottom have
been retired by the process a number of inches. These features
are described as <i>glacier cornices</i> (<a href="#f426">Fig. 426</a>).</p>

<p><b>Glacier drainage.</b>&mdash;Already in the early morning of every
warm summer day, active melting has begun upon the surface of
the Swiss glaciers. Rills of icy water soon make their way along
depressions upon the surface, and are joined to one another so that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
they sometimes form brooks of considerable size (<a href="#f427">Fig. 427</a>). Such
streams continue their serpentine courses until these are intersected
by a crevasse down which the waters plunge in a whirling
vortex which soon develops a vertical shaft of circular section
within the ice. Such shafts with their descending columns of
whirling water are the
well-known <i>moulins</i>,
or “<i>mills</i>”, which
may be detected from
a distance by their
gurgling sounds. The
first plunge of the
water may not reach
to the bottom of the
glacier, in which case
the stream finds a
passageway below the
surface but above the
floor until another
crevasse is encountered and a new plunge made, here perhaps to
the bottom. Once upon the valley floor the stream is joined by
others, and pursues its course within an ice tunnel of its own
making (<a href="#f421">Fig. 421</a>, <a href="#Page_394">p. 394</a>) until it issues at the glacier front.</p>
<p>The coarser of the rock débris which was gathered up by the
stream upon the glacier surface is deposited within the tunnel in
imperfect assortment (gravel and sand), while all finer material
and that lifted from the floor (rock flour) is retained in suspension
and gives to the escaping stream its opaque white appearance.
This <i>glacier milk</i> may generally be traced far down the valleys or
out upon the foreland, and is often the traveler’s first indication
that a range which he is approaching supports glaciers.</p>

</div></div>

<p><b>Deposits within the vacated valley.</b>&mdash;For every excavation
of the higher portions of the upland through glacial sculpture,
there is a corresponding deposit of the excavated materials in
lower levels. So far as these materials are deposited directly by
the ice, they form the lateral, medial, ground, and terminal moraines
already described. A considerable proportion of them are, however,
deposited by the water outside the terminal moraine; but
as with the shrinking glacier the ice front retires in halting movements<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
over the area earlier ice-covered, the terminal moraines are
ranged along the vacated valley as <i>recessional moraines</i>, each with
a <i>valley train</i> of outwash below. About the apron of the piedmont
glacier, such deposits are particularly heavy (<a href="#f428">Fig. 428</a>). During
the “ice age” the Swiss glaciers extended down the valleys below
the existing ice remnants and spread upon the Swiss foreland as
great piedmont glaciers such as may now be seen in Alaska. To-day
we find there moraines and glacial outwash, a lake in the
middle of the apron site, and sometimes a group of radiating drumlins
like those found within the ice lobes of the continental glacier
in southern Wisconsin (<a href="#f429">Fig. 429</a>, and <a href="#f344">Fig. 344</a>, <a href="#Page_317">p. 317</a>).</p>

<p>Behind the recessional moraines within the glaciated valley are
found the valley moraine lakes (<a href="#f448">Fig. 448</a>, <a href="#Page_413">p. 413</a>), in association
with the rock basin lakes due to glacial sculpture (<a href="#f447">Fig. 447</a>, <a href="#Page_412">p. 412</a>).
After the glacier has vacated its valley, the precipitous side walls
become the prey of frostwork and are the scenes of disastrous
avalanches or landslides. Within the cirques, drifts of snow are
nourished long after the ice has disappeared, and as a consequence
the amphitheater walls succumb to the process of solifluxion
(<a href="#Page_153">p. 153</a>).</p>

<p>Diversions and reversals of drainage, which are so characteristic
of the work of continental glaciers, are hardly less common to
glaciated mountain districts. Many of our most beautiful waterfalls
have resulted from either the temporary or permanent obstruction
of earlier valleys above the falls. The famous Yosemite
Falls offers an interesting illustration of the shifting of an earlier
waterfall, itself no doubt due to ice blocking in a still earlier glaciation
(<a href="#p22b">plate 22 B</a>).</p>

<p><b>Marks of the earlier occupation of mountains by glaciers.</b>&mdash;It
is well that we should now bring together within a small compass
those evidences by which the existence of earlier mountain glaciers
may be proven in any district. These marks are so deeply stamped
upon the landscape that no one need err in their interpretation.</p>

<p class="pch">A STUDY OF LAKE BASINS</p>

<p><b>Freshwater and saline lakes.</b>&mdash;Lakes require for their existence
a basin within which water may be impounded, and a supply
of water more than sufficient to meet the losses from seepage and
evaporation. If there is a surplus beyond what is needed to meet
these losses, lakes have outlets and remain fresh; their content
of mineral matter is then too slight to be detected by the palate.
If, on the other hand, supply is insufficient for overflow, continued
evaporation results in a concentration of the mineral content of
the water, subject as it is to continual augmentation from the inflowing
streams.</p>

<p>As we have seen, there are in areas of small rainfall special
weathering processes which tend to bring out the salts from the
interior of rock masses, these concentrated salts generally first
appearing as a surface efflorescence which is ultimately transferred
through the agency of wind and cloudburst to the characteristically
saline desert lakes.</p>

<p>Lake basins may be formed in many ways. Depressions of
the land surface may result from tectonic movements of the crust;
they may be formed by excavating processes; but in by far the
greater number of instances they result from the obstruction in
some manner of valleys which were before characterized by uniformly
forward grades. In relatively few cases loose materials
are heaped up in such a manner as to produce fairly symmetrical
basins.</p>

</div></div>

<p><b>Newland lakes.</b>&mdash;On land recently elevated from the sea,
basins of lakes may be merely the inherited slight irregularities
of the earlier sea floor, in which case they may be assumed to be
largely the result of an irregular distribution of deposits derived
from the land. Lakes of this type are especially well exhibited
in Florida, and are known as newland lakes (<a href="#f430">Fig. 430</a>). Such
lakes are exceptionally shallow, and are apt to have irregular outlines<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>
and extremely low banks. Under these circumstances, they
are soon filled with a rank growth of vegetation, so that it is sometimes
difficult to properly distinguish lake and marsh.</p>

characteristics of basin-range lakes.</p>
</div></div>

<p><b>Basin-range lakes.</b>&mdash;Newland lakes may be said to have their
origin in an uplift of the land and sea floor near their common
margin. A lake type dependent upon movements of the earth’s crust
but within interior areas has been described as the basin-range
type and is exemplified by the Warner Lakes of Oregon. In this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>
district great rectangular blocks of the earth’s crust, which in their
upper portions at least are composed of basaltic lavas, have undergone
vertical adjustments in level and have been tilted so that
the corresponding corners of neighboring blocks have been given
a similar degree of down-tilt
(<a href="#f431">Fig. 431</a>). Lakes
formed in this way are
of triangular outline, are
bounded on the two
shorter sides by cliffs,
but have extremely flat
shores on their longest
side. From this shore the
water increases gradually
in depth and attains a
maximum depth at or
near the opposite angle.
Such lakes naturally betray
a tendency to appear
in series (<a href="#f432">Fig. 432</a>), and are unfortunately much too often illustrated
on a small scale after a shower by the tilted blocks of
imperfectly made cement sidewalks.</p>

with the Dead Sea and the Sea of Galilee as remnants of a larger lake in which
their basins were included.</p>
</div></div>

<p><b>Rift-valley lakes.</b>&mdash;Another type of lake basin which has its
origin in faulted block movements is known as the rift-valley lake,
and is best exemplified by the great lakes of east Central Africa.
In this type a strip of crust, many times as long as it is wide, has
been relatively sunk between the blocks on either side so as to
produce a deep rift, or what in Germany is known as a <i>Graben</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>
(trench). Such a basin when occupied by water yields a lake which
is long, straight, deep, and narrow, and is in addition bounded on
the sides by steep rock cliffs. At the ends the
shores are generally by contrast decidedly low.
If the hard rock at the bottom of the lake
could be examined, it would be found to be of
the same type as that exposed near the top of
the side cliffs. The valley of the Jordan in
Palestine is a rift of this character and was at
one time occupied by a long and narrow lake
of which the Dead Sea and the Sea of Galilee
are the existing remnants (<a href="#f433">Fig. 433</a>).</p>

</div></div>

<p><b>Earthquake lakes.</b>&mdash;The
complex adjustments
in level of the
surface of the ground
at the time of sensible
earthquakes are many
of them made apparent in no other way
than by the derangements of the surface
water. This is at such times impounded
either in pools or in broad lakes, which
inasmuch as they date from known earthquakes
have been called “earthquake
lakes”, even though in a strict sense any
lake which has originated in earth movements
might properly be regarded as an
earthquake lake. To avoid unnecessary
confusion, the term must, however, be restricted
to those lakes which are known to
have been formed at the time of definite earthquakes (<a href="#f435">Fig. 435</a>).
Reelfoot Lake in Tennessee, which in late years has acquired
undesirable notoriety because of the feuds between the fishermen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>
of the district and the constituted authorities, is a lake more than
twenty miles across and came into existence during the great
earthquake of the lower Mississippi valley in 1811.</p>


<p><b>Crater lakes.</b>&mdash;The craters of volcanic mountains are natural
basins in which surface waters are certain to be collected, provided
only the supply is sufficient and seepage into the loose materials is
not excessive. Some craters, still visibly more or less active, are
occupied by lakes (<a href="#f436">Fig. 436</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter">

than half a mile across and with walls 800 feet deep. At intervals there is an
ejection of steam mixed with mud and ash after the manner of a geyser (after
H. Pittier).</p>
</div></div>

<p>In the larger number of cases in which craters become occupied
by lakes, the evidence of continued activity is lacking, and it would
appear in such cases that the lava of the chimney had consolidated
into a volcanic plug, closing the bottom of the crater. Notable
groups of crater lakes are the <i>Caldera</i> of the Roman Campagna
(<a href="#f437">Fig. 437</a>) and the so-called <i>maare</i> of the Eifel about the Lower
Rhine. Crater lakes are easy to recognize by their circular plan,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>
their steep walls of volcanic materials, and their considerable
depth with a maximum near the center.</p>

<p>One of the most remarkable of these water-filled basins is Crater
Lake in Oregon, which has a diameter of about six miles and is
believed to have resulted from the incaving of a great volcanic
cone in the latest stage of its activity. This remarkable feature
has now been made a national park and will soon be conveniently
reached by tourists and counted one of the greatest nature wonders
of the Pacific slope.</p>

</div></div>

<p><b>Coulée lakes.</b>&mdash;Far more important as lakes are those volcanic
basins which arise from the flow of a stream of lava across the valley
of a river so as to impound its
waters (<a href="#f438">Fig. 438</a>).</p>

<p>At the time of the great eruption
under Skaptár Jökull in 1783
the river Skaptár and many of
its tributaries were blocked by
the flow of lava, which it is estimated
exceeded in bulk the mass
of Mont Blanc.</p>

<p><b>Morainal lakes.</b>&mdash;As we have
learned, the obstruction of drainage,
due to the distribution of
rock débris by continental glaciers,
has yielded lakes in almost countless numbers. Probably ninety
per cent or more of the known lakes have had this origin, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span>
type is so common within the once glaciated regions that it forms
perhaps the best distinguishing mark of former glaciation. The
hummocky surface of morainal deposits is so characteristic that
the lakes of this type are never very large and are correspondingly
irregular in outline. They have often numerous islands, and their
banks are formed of the combination of rock flour and ice-worn materials
known as till (<a href="#f439">Fig. 439</a>). The smallest of the morainal
lakes are mere kettles on the marginal moraine, and these rapidly
become replaced by peat bogs. In contrast with pit lakes, morainal
lakes lack the steep surrounding slopes and the encircling
plain.</p>

</div></div>

<p><b>Pit lakes.</b>&mdash;The so-called pit lakes have their origin in continental
glaciation, and are found in groups within broad plains
of glacial outwash (mainly sand and gravel), which are for this
reason described as “pitted plains” (see <a href="#Page_314">p. 314</a>). Those areas
which lay between neighboring lobes of the ice sheet were subject
to particularly heavy deposits of outwash material, and are, in
consequence, particularly likely to be occupied by pit lakes. As
has been pointed out in an earlier section, the water derived from
surface melting within the marginal portions of a continental
glacier descends to the bottom in the crevasses and thereafter
flows in an ice tunnel under the same conditions as water flowing
in a pipe. Having in most cases a considerable head at the outer
margin of the ice, this water may rise and issue well above the lower
ice layers and so cover a portion of the ice margin beneath sand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span>
and gravel (<a href="#f440">Fig. 440</a>). Separated blocks, often of massive proportions,
are thus buried beneath nonconducting materials by
which they are long protected from further melting. Eventually,
however, with the approach of still milder climates they disappear,
thus causing the overlying sand and gravel to descend and form a
pit of steep walls similar to the sawdust pits over melted ice blocks
within our storehouses.</p>

<p>Pit lakes are thus easily recognized by their occurrence usually
in groups within a plain of glacial outwash and by their characteristic
banks inclined at the angle of repose of such materials
(<a href="#f441">Fig. 441</a>).</p>

</div></div>

<p><b>Glint or colk lakes.</b>&mdash;It has been found to be true of existing
continental glaciers that where their mass has been held back by a
mountain wall, their current at the portals within this rampart
becomes greatly accelerated. Though the upper layers of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span>
glacier in the vicinity may move forward with a velocity of but an
inch per day, the current within the outlet may be as much as
seven hundred or a thousand times as great. In many respects
these conditions are similar to those about the raceway of a reservoir
where the near-by surface of the water is lowered by the indraught
of the outlet and the current in the raceway is so accelerated
that, unless protected, the bottom of the race is carried away
and a basin excavated which extends a short distance both above
and below the position of the dam. In Holland such basins hollowed
out beneath breaks in the dykes are known as colks. Basins
which were excavated beneath the glacier outlets by a similar process
would not be open to our
inspection until after the ice had
disappeared from the region;
but it is most significant that in
Scandinavia, where the Pleistocene
continental glacier, advancing

<p><b>Ice-dam lakes.</b>&mdash;Whenever a continental glacier, either in advancing
its front or in retiring, lies across the lines of drainage upon
their downstream side, water is impounded along the ice front
so as to form ice-dam lakes. Such lakes
are found to-day in Greenland and in
the southern Andes, and similar bodies
of water of far greater size and importance
came into existence in Pleistocene
times each time that the continental
glaciers of northern North America
and Europe advanced upon or retired
from suitably directed river systems.
Thus above the Baltic depression, when
the ice front lay to the eastward of the
main watershed, each easterly sloping
valley was obstructed by the ice and
occupied by an ice-dam lake (<a href="#f444">Fig. 444</a>),
the beaches of which may all be traced
to-day (<a href="#f445">Fig. 445</a>).</p>

</div></div>

<p>One side of each ice-dam lake is formed by an ice cliff at the
glacier front, and if the region is relatively flat, the remaining
shores are likely to be formed by a marginal moraine which the
glacier has abandoned in its retreat. In their smaller stages,
therefore, ice-dam lakes on prairie country have the form of a
crescent, which is the more pronounced because the waves by their
attack upon the ice front flatten the curvature of its outline (see
<a href="#f360">Fig. 360</a>, <a href="#Page_330">p. 330</a>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span></p>

<p>The life of an ice-dam lake is begun and ended in important
changes of glacier outline, and after the draining of lakes by this
process the land shores may be traced in beaches, and the ice margin
by a water-laid moraine of low relief (<a href="#f359">Fig. 359</a>, <a href="#Page_330">p. 330</a>).</p>

<p>A much smaller but in many respects similar ice-dam lake is
to-day to be seen at the side of the Great Aletsch glacier, a mountain
glacier of Switzerland. The traveler who makes the easy
ascent of the Eggishorn may look directly down upon this crescent-shaped
lake with its ice cliff on the glacier side (see <a href="#f446">Fig. 446</a>).</p>

<p><b>Glacier lobe lakes.</b>&mdash;Upon the sites of the former lobes of the
Pleistocene glacier of North America are found the basins of the
Laurentian River system, the largest freshwater lakes in the world.
There has been much controversy concerning the manner of formation
of these lakes, but the view which has seemed to have the
largest following is that they were excavated by the eroding action
of the continental glacier over the drainage basins of former
rivers. It is but one phase of the long controversy between opposing
schools, which have advocated on the one hand the efficiency
of glacier ice as an eroding agent, and upon the other its supposed
protection from the weathering processes. The positions and the
outlines of the several lakes of the series sufficiently proclaim their
connection with the former glacial lobes, and the name which we
have adopted leaves the exact manner of their formation a still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span>
open question. The recognition of the importance of the glacial
anticyclone, in giving shape to the glacier surface and in effecting
a transfer of snow from the central to the marginal portions, has
had the effect of emphasizing the relative importance of erosion
under the marginal and lobate portions. Thus the importance of ice
lobes has been greatly accentuated, though this applies only to
the shaping of the basins and not in any important way to the impounding
of the present waters. The present Laurentian Lakes
owe their existence to the elevation by successive uplifts of the
country to the northward and eastward, since the glacier retired
from the lake region. When the ice front lay to the northward of
the Ottawa River, the discharge of the upper lakes was by a channel
through Nipissing River and Lake and thence down the Ottawa
River to a gulf in the lower St. Lawrence. The uplift of the land
has had the effect of raising a barrier where the former outlet
existed, and diverting the waters to a roundabout channel by way
of Detroit and Lake Erie (see <a href="#f365">Fig. 365</a>, <a href="#Page_335">p. 335</a>).</p>

<p><b>Rock-basin lakes.</b>&mdash;The reversed grades which develop in a
valley deepened by mountain glaciers&mdash;the back-tilted treads of
the cascade stairway (see <a href="#Page_376">p. 376</a>)&mdash;furnish a series of basins
hollowed in rock which are strung along the course of the valley
like pearls upon a thread, or, far better, like the larger beads in a
rosary (<a href="#f447">Fig. 447</a>). This characteristic arrangement accounts for
the name “Paternoster Lakes” which has sometimes been applied
to them in Europe. Their positions in series within <span class="font">U</span>-shaped
mountain valleys, and their rock shores with characteristically<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span>
smoothed and striated surfaces, make them easy of determination.
In the higher portions of the valley, where the treads of the
cascade stairway are relatively narrow, such lakes are often approximately
circular in outline, but in the lower levels and upon
wider treads they may be ribbon-like, though lakes of this type
are to a large extent replaced in the lower levels by the valley
moraine type or a combination of the two.</p>

</div></div>

<p><b>Valley moraine lakes.</b>&mdash;The recessional moraines which mark
the halting stations of mountain glaciers, while retiring up their
valleys, form dams in the later river and so produce a type of lake
which is in contrast with the morainal lakes which result from
continental glaciation. They may, therefore, be distinguished
by the name <i>valley moraine lakes</i>. Their positions on the bed of a
<span class="font">U</span>-shaped mountain valley, and the glacial materials which compose
the dams, are sufficient for their identification (<a href="#f448">Fig. 448</a>).
Moraine Lake and Lake Louise in the Canadian Rockies are typical
examples. Rock basin and valley moraine lakes may occur
in alternation or combined in mountain valleys.</p>

</div></div>

<p><b>Landslide lakes.</b>&mdash;The sheer-walled valleys which are carved
by mountain glaciers are too steep to long retain their perpendicularity
when the support of the glacier has been removed. Aided
by the ever present joint planes, which admit water to the rock,
they succumb to frost action, and further give way in avalanches
whenever the rock
is of sufficiently
porous material to
become saturated
with water. Landslides
sometimes
occur successively
until the original valley wall has been replaced by a terraced slope.
The treads of the steps in this terrace have generally a backward-sloping
grade, so that basins are formed to be filled by relatively
long and narrow lakes or by successions of small pools (<a href="#f449">Fig. 449</a>
and <a href="#p23b">plate 23 B</a>).</p>

</div></div>

<p>When the avalanched material is so disposed as to dam the valley,
much larger lakes of this type come into existence. During
an earthquake which occurred on January 25, 1348, there was a
landslide within the valley of the Gail,
Carinthia, which destroyed seventeen
villages and produced a lake which
even to-day is represented by a great
marsh.</p>

<p><b>Border lakes.</b>&mdash;Whenever mountain
glaciers push out their fronts
beyond the borders of the mountain
range by which they are nourished,
they spread upon the foreland in
broad aprons about which morainic
accumulations are particularly heavy.
This elevation of morainal walls about
the margins of the aprons yields natural
basins that are occupied by lakes so
soon as the glacier retires its front
within the valley. Because such lakes
are found at the borders of upland districts they have been called
<i>border lakes</i>. The beautiful Lakes Constance, Lucerne, Maggiore,
Lugano, Como, and Garda (<a href="#f450">Fig. 450</a>), on the borders of the Alpine
highland, are all of this type.</p>

<p><b>Ox-bow lakes.</b>&mdash;The cutting off of a meander within the flood
plain of a river yields a lake which is of horseshoe (ox-bow) outline
and lies generally with low banks within a plain composed of
river silt. Before separating from the parent stream the meander
had begun to silt up, especially at the ends. Ox-bow lakes are,
however, relatively deep near the convex shore and correspondingly
shallow toward the concave margin (<a href="#f451">Fig. 451</a>).</p>

</div></div>

<p><b>Saucer lakes.</b>&mdash;As we have learned, a river meandering in its
flood plain has banks which are higher than the average level of
the plain, for the reason that at flood time the main current of the
stream still persists in the channel, thus allowing the burden of
sediment to be dropped in the
relatively slack water upon its
margin. Because of these natural
embankments or levees, tributary
streams are often compelled to
flow long distances in nearly parallel
direction before effecting a
junction. Between the trunk
stream and its tributaries, likewise bounded by levees, and between
streams and the valley walls, there thus exist low basins
which are more or less saucer-shaped (<a href="#f452">Fig. 452</a>). At flood time,
when the levees are overflowed or crevassed, water enters these
depressions, and an additional supply may be derived from the
walls of the valley. Good illustrations of such lakes are furnished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span>

the present Minnesota River (<a href="#f453">Fig. 453</a>).</p>

</div></div>

<p><b>Crescentic levee lakes.</b>&mdash;As we approach the delta of a river,
the size and importance of the levee increases, and here a new type
of levee lake may develop in series (<a href="#f454">Fig. 454</a>). At flood time the
levee is breached near the point of sharpest curvature on the convex
side (<a href="#f454">Fig. 454</a> <i>a</i>). When the waters are subsiding, the current
is kept away from the old channel by the rising grade of the
levee as well as by the inertia of the current, and an entrance to
the old channel is first found below the next change in curvature
of the meander, since here scour becomes effective in cutting
through the levee. The new channel is thus established in the
form of a loop inclosing the old one, and the process of levee building
now erects a wall about the territory newly acquired by the
meander. This territory has the form of a crescent, and when
occupied by water produces a crescentic levee lake often joined
to its neighbors in series. The abandoned channel now closed
at both ends by levees may be occupied by water to produce a
subordinate ribbon type of curving trench (<a href="#f454">Fig. 454</a> <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>).</p>

<p>The importance of levees in obstructing drainage to form lakes
is only beginning to be appreciated. It has quite recently been
shown that when trunk streams are greatly swollen and burdened
with sediment while flowing from a receding continental glacier,
they may build such high levees as to aggrade their tributary
streams above the junctions, even producing reversed grades
and so impounding the waters to form extensive lakes. During
the “ice age” lakes of this type were formed in Illinois and Kentucky<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span>
rivers just above their junctions with the Ohio. The old
lake floor with its eastern shore line and its protruding islands is
easily made out upon the new topographic maps of Kentucky.</p>

examples of the ribbon type of levee lake due to occupation of the abandoned
river channel. The larger number of lakes, of which Sip Lake and Texas Lake
are examples, have the form of crescents and lie between abandoned levees (from
recent map of U. S. G. S.).</p>
</div></div>

<p><b>Raft lakes.</b>&mdash;Within humid regions the flood plains of our larger
rivers are generally forested, and as the river swings from side to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span>
side in its perpetual meanderings, the timber which grows upon
the convex side of each meander is progressively undermined by
the river and felled upon its bank. The prostrate trees remain
upon the banks during the low water of the summer season, to be
gathered up at the time of flood in the next spring season. It
is log jams thus acquired which so generally block the main channel
of a river and turn the current across the neck of the meander
when cut-offs occur with the formation of ox-bow lakes. When
the mass of timber thus gathered up by the river is excessive, as,
for example, within the flood plain of the Red River of Arkansas
and Louisiana, huge log rafts are produced
which dam up the river so effectively
as to produce temporary lakes.
The impounded waters soon find an
outlet over the levee at some point
higher up the river, and the waters
flowing off through the timbered
bottom lands, other logs are caught
by the standing timber as in a weir.
A second dam is thus formed which is
separated from the initial one by open
water, and in this way the driftwood
dam acquires enormous proportions
as it gradually moves up the river.
After a period of perhaps a century
or more, the lower sections of the
jam become decayed and dislodged so as to float down the river.</p>

<p>In the lower Red River a great raft of alternating jams and
open water reached a length of about one hundred and sixty miles
and moved up the river at the average rate of something less
than a mile per year. Within the limits of the dam all tributary
streams were blocked, so that secondary lakes were formed in a
double fringe about the main river (<a href="#f455">Fig. 455</a>). The great raft
which formed here in the latter part of the fifteenth century
has now at the beginning of the twentieth been largely removed

Lakes in the valley of the

have been formed in
this way (<a href="#f354">Fig. 354</a>, <a href="#Page_326">p. 326</a>). Lakes Thun and Brienz in the Swiss

<p><b>Delta lakes.</b>&mdash;A somewhat different

the gulf. Here the various distributaries
radiate from the main
channel to produce the “bird-foot”

by their junction with the banks

have separated in succession a series

<p>A type of delta lake, which more resembles the side-delta lake
above described, has formed at the mouth of the Colorado River,
where it enters the Gulf of Lower
California. The Imperial Valley
lying to the north of this delta is
the desiccated floor of the earlier
Gulf of Lower California which has
been captured from the sea by the
delta of the Colorado. The rampart
of mountains, by which this valley
is surrounded, has cut it off from
any water supply derived from
clouds, and its waters being no
longer renewed from the sea, the
region has passed through a period
of desiccation which has left the
Salton Sink as the only existing remnant of the earlier lagoon. It
will be remembered that careless operations in diverting distributaries
of the Colorado recently reversed this process so that the
waters rose in the valley, and expensive emergency operations
were necessary in order to again turn the waters of the Colorado
into their accustomed channels.</p>

<p><b>Barrier lakes.</b>&mdash;The Salton Sink illustrates a type of lake
which is formed at the border of the sea through the erection of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span>
some kind of barrier which captures a small area of the ocean’s
surface. Though such lakes may be properly described as strand
lakes, it is usually at the mouth of a river that the process becomes
effective. The common type of <i>barrier lakes</i> is found
developed on most ragged coast lines where the
shore currents have formed first bars and later
barriers at the mouths of the estuaries (<a href="#f459">Fig. 459</a>).
Such embankments are usually gently curving
or crescent shaped and are composed of sand or
shingle which presents a steep landward and a
gradual seaward slope.</p>

lakes on the coast

</div></div>

<p><b>Dune lakes.</b>&mdash;Within the narrow strips of
shore in which all the fine soil that could be
available for plant life has been washed away by
the waves, beach sand is exposed to the direct
action of the winds. In time of storm the sand
is picked up and after drifting in the wind is
collected in long ridges parallel to the shore.
Constantly traveling along shore, these dunes block the mouths
of rivers and thus produce a series of lakes such as are indicated
in <a href="#f460">Fig. 460</a>.</p>

<p><b>Sink lakes.</b>&mdash;Another class of lakes are due either directly
or indirectly to the work of underground waters. In districts
which are underlain by limestone, the surface water descending<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span>
along the joints of the limestone may widen these passageways
through solution of the rock and at lower levels flow on the floors
of caverns eaten out by the same process on bedding planes of the
formation. At the intersections of joints, more or less circular
shafts known as “swallow-holes” go down to the caves from the
surface. Locally, also the cavern roofs give way so as to choke
the galleries with rubble and leave a basin at the surface which
has an irregular but generally a more or less oval outline. If
sufficiently clogged at the bottom by finer rock débris, these basins
become occupied by small lakes which are known as sinks, and
constitute one of the best surface indications of a limestone
country.</p>

manner of their formation (map from U. S. G. S.).</p>
</div></div>

<p><b>Karst lakes&mdash;poljen.</b>&mdash;In the limestone country to the north
and east of the Adriatic Sea&mdash;the so-called Karst region&mdash;there
are many interesting features which are directly traceable to the
solution of the country rock. Here all the surface water descends
in certain districts along the widened joint planes so that the
drainage is largely subterranean. The so-called <i>dolines</i> or sinks of
very regular and symmetrical forms resembling deep bowls cover
a large part of the surface.</p>

<p>The entire country is, moreover, faulted in the most intricate
fashion into many rift valleys. The drainage being so largely
subterranean, these downthrown blocks of crust, the so-called
<i>poljen</i>, become flooded at certain seasons of the year when the
subterranean passages become choked or are too small to carry
away all the water. A seasonal lake of this character is the
Zirknitz Lake (<a href="#Page_189">p. 189</a>).</p>


<p><b>Playa lakes.</b>&mdash;It is the law of the desert that the arid region
be walled in by mountains. This encircling rampart forces the
clouds to rise, and by robbing them of their moisture leaves the
desert dry and barren. Those waters which fall upon the inner
margin of the ranges drain toward the interior of this pan-like
depression and are not returned to the sea&mdash;the desert is without
an outlet. Infrequent though they be, the desert rains are of
the cloudburst type and in the hills develop torrents whose waters,
emerging upon the desert floor, develop lakes in the space of a
few minutes or at most hours. In the hot and dry atmosphere
the waters of these shallow basins may be sucked up in the space
of a few hours but reappear in the same basins at the time of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span>
next succeeding cloudburst. Such ephemeral lakes are known
as playas.</p>


<p><b>Salines.</b>&mdash;Desert lakes more favored in their supply of water
may be relatively long lived and persist for periods measured in
years or centuries. Such lakes are, however, extremely sensitive
to climatic changes (see <a href="#Page_198">p. 198</a>).</p>

<p>For the reason that they have no outlet the waters of desert
lakes become salt through continued evaporation. They are,
therefore, spoken of as <i>salines</i>. Lake Bonneville, so long as it
discharged its waters over the sill of the Red Rock Pass, must
have remained fresh; but when the level of its waters had fallen
below this outlet, its waters became salt and the content increased
as the volume diminished.</p>

<p>The shallow basins upon the floors of desert lakes may have
come into existence in various ways; but it would appear that
the irregular removal of the soil by the winds, modified as this is by
differences in composition of the rock materials and by vegetable
growth, and the deposition of sand by the same agent, are by far
the most important. Many of the types of tectonic and volcanic
lakes which have been described are characteristic of humid and
arid regions alike.</p>


<p><b>Alluvial-dam lakes.</b>&mdash;Within the mountains upon the desert
borders, the alluvial fans which form at the mouths of valleys,
because of the characteristic cloudburst, sometimes obstruct a
main valley at the junction with its tributaries. By this process
the waters of the main river are impounded in essentially the
same manner as are the rivers of humid regions by the deltas
of their tributaries.</p>


<p><b>Résumé.</b>&mdash;The types of lakes which we have now considered
are arranged below in tabular form so as to show their relationship
to important geological processes. While not complete,
the list includes the more important classes, as well as others
which, while not of common occurrence, are yet of interest in giving
further illustration to the processes which have been treated
in earlier chapters.</p>

<p>By giving careful attention to criteria which have been above
suggested, it should be possible in the greater number of instances
at least to determine whether any lake which is visited has had its
origin in one or another of the processes described.</p>

<p class="pch">THE EPHEMERAL EXISTENCE OF LAKES</p>

<p><b>Lakes as settling basins.</b>&mdash;Of all the processes which conspire
to blot out the lakes with which our northern landscapes are
dotted, the one of greatest importance is in most cases a process
of filling by the sediments brought in by tributary streams. The
carrying of sediment in suspension depends, as we know, upon the
velocity of the current, and as this is checked where it reaches
the lake margin, all coarser material is at once deposited to form
a delta, while the finer sediments are held longer in suspension and
finally settle in thin layers over the entire bottom of the lake.
Clay deposits surrounded by coarser sediments are thus characteristic
of filled lake basins.</p>

Lake Geneva as a settling basin of the larger stream.</p>
</div></div>

<p>How waters are clarified by their passage through a lake is
indicated by a comparison of a river system such as the St. Lawrence,
with a river like the Missouri and Mississippi. Not only
are the lower stretches of the St. Lawrence in striking contrast
with the muddy floods of the Missouri and Mississippi; but the
delta, which is so remarkable a feature in the Mississippi, has
no counterpart in the northern river.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span></p>

<p>The most noteworthy examples of settling are, however, furnished
by the lakes of Switzerland, for the reason that <span class="smcap">Swiss</span>
rivers are heavily charged with rock flour produced beneath the
numerous glaciers at the valley heads, and, further, because these
rivers descend with turbulent currents to near the borders of the
larger lakes. To look out upon the murky waters of the upper
Rhone, where they enter Lake Geneva near Villeneuve, and then
to watch the flood of crystal water which issues from the lake
and passes under the bridge at Geneva, is an object lesson which
no traveling student should miss (<a href="#f462">Fig. 462</a>). Yet even more instructive
is a visit to the <i>Bois de la Bâtie</i> at the junction of this
clear stream with the Arve, a half hour’s walk only below Geneva.
The waters of the Arve have come on a steep descent directly
from the glaciers of the Mont Blanc district, and as they meet
the cleared waters of the Rhone, they flow beside them down
the common valley without mingling. Dull and opaque, the
Arve waters can be discerned for a long distance as a white belt
against the left bank of the river, sharply defined against the blue
reflecting surface of the Rhone waters (<a href="#f463">Fig. 463</a>). Upon the
banks of the Arve, just above its junction, a cement manufactory
has been established to utilize the clays which are here deposited.</p>

<p>Wherever lakes are contained in long and narrow valleys, the
greater part of the tributary drainage enters at the upper end,
and the delta which there forms
extends from bank to bank. As
it continues to advance into the
lake, the earlier water basin is
gradually transformed into a level
plain of delta deposit, a feature
so common as to be deserving of a
special name. The Scottish lochs,
which are lakes of this type, are
each extended in a longer or shorter
delta plain described as a <i>strath</i>,
and this local term may well be
given a general application (frontispiece).
The city of Ithaca, the
seat of Cornell University, is built
upon a strath at the head of Lake Cayuga, and numberless Scottish
and Swiss hamlets have been located upon such fertile plains
(<a href="#f464">Fig. 464</a>).</p>

</div></div>

<p><b>Drawing off of water by erosion of outlet.</b>&mdash;Next in importance
to the filling up of lake basins as a factor in their early
extinction is the cutting down of their channels of outflow.
Whenever the walls of the outlet are cut in rock, this draining
process is apt to be slow, for the reason that the outlet
stream is of filtered water and so lacks the necessary cutting
tools. By far the larger number of lakes are, however, held
back by dams of loose drift deposits laid down by the earlier
continental glaciers; and so the very clarity of the water promotes
the erosion of the outlet by allowing the stream’s full
burden of sediment to be lifted and then removed from the
channel.</p>


<p><b>The pulling in of headlands and the cutting off of bays.</b>&mdash;The
removal of projecting headlands by wave action, though it increases
the area of the lake, yet it decreases directly the volume
of lake water through formation of the built terrace, and indirectly
in far larger measure through the transformation of bays
into quiet lagoons within which the extinguishing process of peat
growth is set in operation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a></span></p>


<p><b>Lake extinction by peat growth.</b>&mdash;The first condition for the
growth of lake vegetation is quiet water. Within small lakes,
such as the kettle basins upon moraines, aquatic vegetation develops
rapidly, and bogs of peat might almost be included among
the most important distinguishing marks of a glaciated country.
Within larger lakes it is only after barrier beaches have been thrown
across the mouths of the bays to form natural breakwaters for
the waves that this process of lake extinction by peat growth
can become effective.</p>

zones of vegetation in a small glacial lake of the Yellowstone
National Park (after a photograph by Fairbanks).</p>
</div></div>

<p>Many erroneous notions are still held concerning the prime
importance of sphagnum in peat formation, owing to the peculiar
local conditions
under which the
early studies were
made. Within the
glaciated districts of
the United States,
the formation of
peat involves the
successive growths
of a number of
zones of vegetation
and the formation
of a floating bog
which advances into
the lake from the
shores, followed in
turn by belts of low shrubs, tamaracks, and lastly deciduous
trees (<a href="#f465">Fig. 465</a>).</p>

<p>In most cases the first plants to develop in a quiet lake are the
water lilies, though these are sometimes preceded by chara and
floating bladderwort. Next behind the water lilies come the
sedges, which form a mat of floating bog by their grasslike stems
sinking down in the water and being there interwoven with the
rhizomes below. This mat of sedge is often so firm that cattle
may advance upon it to the water’s edge, but it is separated
by a layer of water from the bed of growing peat at the bottom
of the lake (<a href="#f466">Fig. 466</a>). This bed of peat appears to grow upward
toward the surface and become joined to the shore end of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[430]</a></span>
floating bog by decaying vegetation which is dropped from the
bottom of the mat above.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

     <div class="caption"><p class="pc400"><span class="smcap">Fig. 466.</span>&mdash;Diagram to show how small lakes are transformed into peat bogs
(after C. A. Davis).</p>
</div></div>

<p>In order behind the floating bog come the advanced plants
of the conifer group, with sphagnum and low shrub here upon a
peat base extending to the lake bottom. Behind the belt of
shrubs arise the tamaracks and spruces, and lastly, toward the
shore, come the deciduous trees and especially poplars, maples,
and marginal willows. Upon the margin of the basin there is
usually a low trench, or “fosse”, filled with water during wet seasons,
as a result, no doubt, of seasonal inwash that does not reach
the residual lake toward the center of the basin.</p>

<p><b>Extinction of lakes in desert regions.</b>&mdash;In arid regions there
are special causes of lake extinction. Thus the blowing in of
sand and dust carried for long distances in the air, a by no
means negligible factor even in humid regions, here assumes
large importance. The now exposed basins of extinct desert
lakes afford the evidence, however, of an even greater factor
of extinction, in climatic change. The clouds, which at one
time found their way into the drainage basin of a lake, may
later through the rise of a mountain barrier be cut off, and
so with reduced water supply a period of lake desiccation
is begun. When, in this process of drying up, the lake level
has fallen below that of the outlet, the saline content of the
waters begins to increase, and later a stage is reached, as in
Great Salt Lake, when the sodium salts are precipitated. When
the lake has become extinct, these deposits remain as a witness
to the changed climatic condition.</p>


<p><b>The rôle of lakes in the economy of nature.</b>&mdash;It is natural,
in considering the extinction of lakes, to give some attention to
the rôle which they play in the economy of nature. That lakes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[431]</a></span>
filter the water of rivers, and prevent the formation of important
delta deposits, has already been noticed. A curious exception
to this general rule is furnished by the great delta at the head of
Lake St. Clair, just below the outlet of Lake Huron. This anomaly
is, however, explained by the peculiar currents of Lake Huron,
which are so directed as to sweep the beach sand into the swift
current of the outlet, to be deposited in the quiet
waters of Lake St. Clair (<a href="#f467">Fig. 467</a>).</p>

<div class="floatright">

Cole).</p>
</div></div>

<p>As regulators of the flow of rivers, lakes perform
an important function. Such disastrous floods as
are characteristic of the spring season within the
basin of the lower Mississippi could not occur in
the lower St. Lawrence, for the reason that the
great basins of the lakes serve as distributing reservoirs.
The annual floods, upon which the agriculture
of Egypt depends, are explained by the
flood waters from the high mountains of Abyssinia
entering the Nile <i>below</i> the lakes of its upper basin.</p>

<p>In one further respect large inland bodies of
water have an important function as regulators.
It is the property of water to respond but slowly
to the variations in the quantity of heat which
reaches the earth’s surface from the sun. A larger
quantity of heat must be added to or abstracted
from a body of water, in order to change its temperature
by one degree, than would be required for a like change
in the same bulk of earth or rock. Thus bodies of water by more
slowly acquiring the summer’s heat retard the coming spring, and
by storing up this energy and carrying it over into the autumn
the warm season is prolonged and early frosts prevented. The
fruit belts about the lower Great Lakes are thus dependent upon
this regulating property of the lake waters. The discomfort of
the long spring of raw weather is thus compensated by an unusually
salubrious harvest season.</p>


<p><b>Ice ramparts on lake shores.</b>&mdash;Small ridges known as ice ramparts
are formed upon lake shores by the action of lake ice, though
subject to so many qualifying conditions that the range of their
occurrence is somewhat limited. Within districts where a winter

to present ridges of bowlders parallel to and near the water’s
edge, and such lakes have sometimes become known as “wall
lakes” (<a href="#f468">Fig. 468</a>).</p>

York.</p>
</div></div>

<p>In many cases these small ridges have been formed at the time
of the spring “break up” of the ice; for the ice cover, when once
loosened, is drifted in great
rafts first against one shore,
and later, with a change of
wind direction, against another.
Under the impact of
such heavy rafts, the half-submerged
bowlders near the
shore are forced up the beach
until they lie in a ridge or
bowlder wall.</p>

<p>At other times such bowlder
walls, and far more interesting
ridges as well, result from a kind of ice shove independent of the
wind, but caused by expansion within the ice itself during a sudden
rise of temperature of the surrounding air. Such ice ramparts
require for their explanation a consideration of the sequence of
events from the time the ice cover closes the lakes.</p>

</div></div>

<p>The first lake ice of early winter forms in most cases with air
temperatures a few degrees only below the freezing point of the
water. When later a severe “cold wave” arrives, the ice cover
is contracted and becomes too small for the lake surface. To this
contraction it yields and opens cracks up which the water rises,
and in the prevailing low temperature this water is quickly frozen
and the lake cover again made complete. Skaters are familiar
with the opening of these cracks and the loud “roaring” which
accompanies it on cold mornings, the sharp skate runners sometimes
starting a crack in the strained ice, as does a light scratch
upon glass that is in a similar strained condition.</p>

<p>The original ice cover of the lake, which was formed at near-freezing
temperatures, has now received a number of inserted
wedges of new ice at a time when its contracted volume has made
this possible. If now a “warm wave” succeeds to the “cold
wave” in the air, the ice cover expands at a rate corresponding
to its rate of contraction, so that a strong pressure is exerted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[433]</a></span>
against the shore (<a href="#f469">Fig. 469</a>). Sliding up the sloping surface of
the cut and built terrace, the force of this shove may be deflected
upward against the cliff, and if this is of loose materials, the effect
may be to ram bowlders into the bank, to push up ramparts or
ridges, to overturn trees, etc. (<a href="#f470a">Fig. 470</a>). In marsh land the
frozen surface layer may slide over
its unfrozen base and be forced up
into broken folds (lower diagram
of <a href="#f469">Figs. 469</a> and <a href="#f470a">470</a>).</p>

shores of the bays (based on Buckley’s map).</p>
</div></div>

<p>In order that ice ramparts may
be formed, it is necessary that the
winter climate of the district be
severe and characterized by alternating
cold and warm waves, involving
considerable range of air temperature below the freezing
point. If the lake is small, the push of the ice will be through so
small a distance as not to yield appreciable ramparts. If, on the
other hand, the lake is too large, the ice cover is not rigid enough
to transmit the push to the distant shore, but, like a long beam<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span>
employed in the same manner to transmit a compressive stress,
it is bent out of a straight line and later broken. Thus in a broad
lake, with the coming of a “warm wave”, the ice cover opens in
a crack from shore
to shore and finds
relief from the stress
by pushing up a ridge
above the crack. On
such lakes ice ramparts
are found only
about the shores of
bays whose expanse
does not greatly exceed
a mile (<a href="#f471">Fig. 471</a>).</p>

<p>When there is
heavy snowfall, ice
ramparts either do
not form or are of
smaller dimensions, probably in part because the ice is blanketed
by the snow and so prevented from sudden elevation of temperature
during the “warm wave”, but even more because the ice
cover is sensibly bowed down under its load and so rendered
incompetent to transmit the developed stresses to the shores.</p>

<p class="pch">THE ORIGIN AND THE FORMS OF MOUNTAINS</p>

<p><b>A mountain defined.</b>&mdash;As ordinarily understood, mountains
are elevations upon the earth’s surface which rise above the
general level of the country. Their summits need not be at great
heights above the sea, but it is essential that they project above
the average level of the surrounding country by at least a quarter
of a mile. Lower elevations are described as hills. On the other
hand, the elevation of a plateau like the “High Plains” of the
western United States may be as much as a mile, but the vast
expanse of nearly level surface precludes the use of the term
“mountain.” The word is thus applied to a feature of the earth
and not merely to an elevated tract.</p>

<p>In a collective sense, though more often in the plural form,
the term is properly applied to groups of similar features which
have a common origin in local uplift of the land. The origin of
mountains used in this sense of mountain complexes is thus
connected with some essentially local uplift of the earth’s surface.
This may take place by the processes of folding and superincumbent
fault displacement, by volcanic extravasations or ejections,
or by a deeper seated and essentially hydrostatic elevation
of rock beds over molten rock material.</p>

<p>The existing <i>forms</i> of mountains, as we are to see, are largely
shaped by the erosional processes which are set in operation
by the uplift itself, though often completed long subsequent
to it.</p>


<p><b>The festoons of mountain arcs.</b>&mdash;From our earliest studies
of school geographies, we have become familiar with the arrangement
of the more important mountains in long chains or systems.
Comparatively few persons have given any further attention to
the arrangement of the chains, though over large areas of the
earth’s surface the distribution of mountain ranges is deeply significant.
The map of Asia in particular presents a series of great
sweeping arcs or crescents which are grouped as though hung<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[436]</a></span>
upon the map in festoons with knots or vertexes to separate
neighboring groups (<a href="#f474">Fig. 474</a>, <a href="#Page_438">p. 438</a>, and <a href="#f472">Fig. 472</a>).</p>

     <div class="cf"><p class="ch250"><span class="smcap">Fig. 472.</span>&mdash;The great multiple mountain arc of
Sewestan, British India (after de Saint Martin
and Schrader).</p>
</div></div>

<p>The significance of these mountain groupings in the evolution
of the earth’s surface
has been pointed out
by the great Viennese
geologist Suess, to whom
we are indebted for focusing
upon the plan of
the earth an amount of
attention which before
had been largely given
to the preparation of
hypothetical sections
of strata which were
largely buried from sight
beneath the earth’s surface.
Broadly speaking,
the mountain arcs may
be said to be grouped
about those shields of older rock which geological studies have
shown to be the oldest land masses upon the globe. Within the
northern hemisphere these original continents are represented by
the areas of crystalline rock centered over Hudson Bay, the Baltic
Sea, and an area in northeastern Siberia known to geologists as
Angara Land. In our study of the figure of the earth (Chapter II)
it was found that these shields represent the truncated angles of
the rounded tetrahedral form toward which the planet is tending
(<a href="#f3">Fig. 3</a>, <a href="#Page_12">p. 12</a>).</p>


<p><b>Theories of origin of the mountain arcs.</b>&mdash;The mountain
arcs, when studied in detail, are found to be composed of closely
folded rock strata, the flexures of which are generally so overturned
that their axial planes dip toward the center of the arc (<a href="#f473">Fig. 473</a>).
It was the view of Suess that these arcs are to be explained
by a pushing outward of the rock strata from the center of the
arc toward its periphery, thus causing a wrinkling of the surface
strata and an overriding of the surrounding formations, which
upon this hypothesis opposed a greater resistance to the sliding
movement. The folding together of the strata due to the sliding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[437]</a></span>
naturally involves a very considerable diminution of the surface
area presented by the strata (<a href="#f22">Fig. 22</a>, <a href="#Page_42">p. 42</a>). In the case of the
Alpine chains it has been estimated that a flat land area, four
hundred to eight hundred miles across, has by the folding process
been reduced to a width of only about one hundred miles, or from
a fourth to an eighth of its former width.</p>

     <div class="cf"><p class="ch200"><span class="smcap">Fig. 473.</span>&mdash;<i>a</i>, diagram to illustrate
the Suess’ theory of the
origin of mountain arcs; <i>b</i>, the
author’s modification of this
view.</p>
</div></div>

<p>The weakness of Professor Suess’ theory lies in the fact that
such compression as it implies is assumed to be due to an
<i>outward</i> movement of the relatively
small area of the earth’s outer shell
which is included <i>within</i> the arc. It
must be obvious that such a movement,
being from a center toward three
sides at once, would for this circumscribed
area involve enormous proportionate
reduction in superficial area
of the strata and could only result in
a hiatus near the center of the arc.
No such gap is to be found, and one
would, moreover, be difficult to account
for upon any plausible hypothesis. On
the other hand, the general contraction
of the planet as a whole, involving
as it does reduction of surface over
large areas, is a well-recognized fact;
and if it be true that the shields
formed by the older continents are less subject to contraction than
the remaining portions of the surface, it is easy to understand why
the earth’s outer skin should be wrinkled by <i>underfolding</i> and
thrusting about these continental margins. The contrast of this
view with that of Professor Suess is expressed in the diagrams of
<a href="#f473">Fig. 473</a>.</p>

</div></div>

<p>We may illustrate this conception by a stretched sheet of rubber
cloth such as is in common use by dentists, upon which a
thin layer of hot Canada balsam has been spread. This substance
congeals upon cooling to near-normal temperatures, and if a small
local area of the balsam layer be chilled and the tension upon the
rubber then released, the viscous balsam of the unchilled portion
of the layer is thrown into wrinkles about the cooled and more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[438]</a></span>
resistant areas. These more resistant portions of the stratum
may thus represent the ancient continental shields of our planet.</p>

<p><b>The Atlantic and
Pacific coasts contrasted.</b>&mdash;In
his
studies of mountain
arcs in their
relation to the
plan of the earth,
Professor Suess
has shown how
the arrangements
of the mountain
chains about the
two larger oceans
represent two
strongly contrasted
types.
Whereas about
the Pacific margin
the mountain arcs are, as it were, strung in festoons which trend
parallel to and are convex toward the coast, or else lie in fringing
garlands of islands in the same attitude (<a href="#f474">Fig. 474</a>); the mountain
chains about the Atlantic become sharply truncated as they reach
the coast, and thus indicate
that the basin of this ocean
has been produced by an inthrow
or depression between
great marginal displacements
in some period subsequent
to the formation of
the mountains.</p>

<p>Thus the mountain folds
of the Appalachian system
are in Newfoundland cut
off abruptly at the coast
line, and the same beds,
similarly truncated, are encountered
again across the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[439]</a></span>
expanse of ocean in the folds at the coast of western Europe (<a href="#f475">Fig. 475</a>).
In discontinuous remnants this ancient mountain chain may
be traced in an east and west direction across western and central
Europe. We have thus here to do with a single mountain
system which extends from central Europe to northern Alabama,
out of which a great link has been taken by the subsequent
sinking in of the basin of the Atlantic Ocean.</p>

</div></div>

<p><b>The block type of mountain.</b>&mdash;The inclusion of most elevations
in mountain chains and arcs is one of the most obvious
facts to any one who has examined
world atlases with this subject in
mind. Such chains are almost invariably
composed of folded rocks,
thus indicating that erosion has
removed great superincumbent
masses of strata since the crustal
compression produced the folds at
considerable depths below the then
surface.</p>

<p>There are, however, large elevated tracts upon the earth’s surface
which are intersected by deep valleys, but where no arrangement
of the elevated portions within chains or ranges is to be
detected. In such cases the distribution of mountain and valley
may bear a resemblance to a mosaic of disturbed parts which
stand at different levels
(<a href="#f476">Fig. 476</a>).</p>

<div class="floatleft">
     <img src="images/ill-522b.jpg" width="250" height="184" id="f477"

     <div class="cf"><p class="pc250"><span class="smcap">Fig. 477.</span>&mdash;Section of an East African block
mountain (after J. W. Gregory).</p>
</div></div>

<p>Such block mountain districts
are to be found in
many parts of the earth’s
surface, but notably within
the Great Basin of the
western United States, and
in the land area which
borders the Indian Ocean
upon the west and northwest.
In contrast with the
mountain arcs, so strikingly
exemplified by the continent of Asia as a whole, its extreme southwestern
portion is made up of an alternation of plateau and rift<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[440]</a></span>
valley separated from each other by great displacements. Though
modified to some extent by erosion, the elevations seem generally
to represent the displaced crust blocks which in mutual adjustments
have been left at the highest levels (<a href="#f477">Fig. 477</a>). The valley
of the Jordan, with the mountains of Lebanon rising above it, is
near the northern extremity of this faulted mountain region (<a href="#f434">Fig. 434</a>,
<a href="#Page_404">p. 404</a>), while the Great Rift valley, crossing east Central
Africa, and the many neighboring rifts to the east and west, are
graven in lines so deep that an observer upon a neighboring planet
might perhaps detect them.</p>

<p>It is not necessary in all cases to assume that the block mountains
of a faulted district represent the blocks which in the adjustments
were left the highest. Erosion in the course of time
accomplishes marvels of transformation, and it may result that
heavy masses of more resistant rock eventually project the highest,
even though they may represent the downthrown blocks in
the fault mosaic (<a href="#f43">Fig. 43</a>, <a href="#Page_60">p. 60</a>).</p>

</div></div>

<p>Where in addition to undergoing changes of level the earth
blocks have been tilted, the features long since described from our
western interior basin as “Basin Range structure” are developed.
Here the upper surface of the disturbed earth blocks betrays the
evidence of a definite tilt in some one direction (<a href="#f478">Fig. 478</a>, and <a href="#f431">Fig. 431</a>,
<a href="#Page_402">p. 402</a>).</p>

<p><b>Mountains of outflow or upheap.</b>&mdash;An important type of mountain,
generally described as volcanic, may be due either to the outflow
of lava at the earth’s surface, or to accumulations of separated
fragments of lava, first thrown into the air, and then deposited
by gravity or admixed with water as volcanic mud. Such mountains,
both before and after modification by erosion, assume the
strikingly characteristic forms which have been fully discussed in
Chapters IX and X. The dominant types are the lava dome and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[441]</a></span>
the puy, the cinder cone, and the more complex composite cone.
Excepting only the surface produced by the few great fissure eruptions
and the semivolcanic mesa type, the individual mountains
of volcanic origin develop features with notably circular bases.</p>

<p><b>Domed mountains of uplift&mdash;laccolites.</b>&mdash;At a considerable
number of widely separated localities upon the earth’s surface,
mountainous regions are encountered, the central areas or cores
of which are composed of intrusive igneous rock such as granite,
and about this core the sediments dip away in all directions as
though they
had once
formed a continuous
roof
above it and
had been
forced into
this dome by
hydrostatic
pressure of
the once viscous
material
beneath (<a href="#f152">Fig. 152</a>,
<a href="#Page_143">p. 143</a>,
and <a href="#f479">Figs. 479</a>
and <a href="#f480">480</a>). Examples
of such
domed mountains
of uplift
were first described
by
Gilbert from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[442]</a></span>
the Henry Mountains of Utah, but instances are furnished by
many elevated tracts, especially within the western United States.
Such mountains are known as <i>laccolites</i>,
but when one margin at least
of the igneous core corresponds to
a displacement, the mountain is described
as a <i>bysmalite</i> (<a href="#f481">Fig. 481</a>).</p>

<div class="floatleft">

     <div class="cf"><p class="pc250"><span class="smcap">Fig. 481.</span>&mdash;Ideal sections of laccolite
and bysmalite.</p>
</div></div>

<p>When subjected to long-continued
erosion, the generally fissured granitic
core of the laccolite weathers in a
wholly different manner from the
bedded sediments which surround
and still in part mount over it. The former usually presents a
more or less jagged surface which contrasts sharply with the gently
sloping tables of the latter (<a href="#f479">Fig. 479</a>). About the high granite core
of the mountain, the several strata of the uptilted formations present
each a steep slope toward this higher land, and a gentler slope
in the opposite direction. Such unsymmetrical ridges which surround
the mountain area are often referred to as “hog backs”
(<a href="#p12b">plate 12 B</a>). The arrangement of the strata in the hog backs thus
presents an overlapping series like the shingles upon a roof, except
that the overlapping is here from the bottom instead of the
top, and the exposed ends thus face toward the crest. Unlike a
shingle roof the hog backs do not shed the water which descends to
them from the higher levels, but, on the contrary, they cause it to
flow in troughs parallel to the base of the slope except where outlets
are found through them.</p>


<p><b>Mountains carved from plateaus.</b>&mdash;In the mountain types
thus far discussed, the local uplifting of the land has itself developed
features which in the aggregate may be referred to as mountains,
even though the characters of the original surface are soon destroyed
by erosive processes of one sort or the other. Erosive
processes are, however, quite competent to produce mountain
forms from a featureless plateau, and particularly through the
incision by streams of running water, the best studied process of
mountain sculpture (see <a href="#Page_149">Chapters XI-XIII</a>). This process of
throwing valleys about an elevated section of the earth’s surface,
and so carving out mountains, is sometimes described as <i>circumvallation</i>;
and if the term “mountain” be applied in its ordinary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[443]</a></span>
sense to describe an individual feature, it is clear that most mountains
have been formed in this way.</p>

<p>To discuss the characteristic shapes of such mountains would
be largely to review the contents of this book, and especially those
portions which discuss the character profiles resulting from the
action of each sculpturing or molding agent. The work of frost
and other weathering agencies, of running water, of mountain and
of continental glacier, would all have to be considered in order to
evolve the history of each mountain.</p>

<p>In addition to discovering the agents which were chiefly responsible
for the shaping of the mountain, we may, further, in
many cases determine at what stage the work of one agent has
been succeeded by that of another, and at least at what stage
of its complete cycle of activity the latest agent is now at work.</p>

</div></div>

<p><b>The climatic conditions of the mountain sculpture.</b>&mdash;Since
the different geological agencies operate either in a different manner
or with differences in vigor according to the varying climatic
conditions, the mountains of arid regions may in most cases be
readily differentiated from those of the more habitable humid sections
of country. In broad lines these differences may be summed
up in the greater prevalence of the curving line within the landscapes
of humid districts. This may be largely ascribed to the
influence of the mat of vegetation, which protects the rock surface
from more rapid mechanical degeneration, and arrests the
sliding movements within the already loosened rock débris. In
place of the reversed curves of the lines of beauty, so generally
observed in the landscapes of well-watered regions, the desert
lands present ever a repetition of the vertical cliff alternating with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[444]</a></span>
a sort of many gabled façade which is occasionally due to truncation
of mountain spurs by the waves of former lakes, but far more
often the outlines of débris cones built up beneath each prominent
joint of the cliff walls (<a href="#f482">Fig. 482</a>).</p>


<p><b>The effect of the resistant stratum.</b>&mdash;In a striking manner
mountain landscapes may disclose the influence of the diversified
rock materials and of the rock structures as well. After prolonged
erosion there is likely to be little correspondence between the positions
of the anticlinal folds and the crests of the higher mountains.
Such mountains are, in fact, much more likely to rise over synclines
than upon the site of anticlines. The traveler who enters
the Alps by any of the several railways, or who journeys by steamer
over the beautiful lake of Lucerne, has a most favorable opportunity
to study the position of the rock folds in the mountain
sections that are unrolled in succession before him. Rarely indeed
will he find a definite anticline in correspondence with a mountain
peak, for the layers which are most resistant have developed
the peaks, and it is because the outer layers of the anticlines open
by local tension (see <a href="#f26">Fig. 26</a>, <a href="#Page_45">p. 45</a>) that they were first cut away
by erosion, so that the hard
layers within the synclines
are likely to constitute the
peaks within the existing surface.</p>

the term “mountain” in its collective sense for a circumscribed
area of uplifted crust, whether represented to-day by a folded or
a faulted complex, a lava mass, or a granite dome; the period of

agencies. By these the mass is pared down as it is shaped into
a more or less intricate design of component and essentially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[445]</a></span>
repeating units. In the vernacular the word “mountain” is
applied to these units into which the larger mountain mass is
subdivided.</p>

</div></div>

<p>It has been one of the main objects of this work to point out
that the peculiar shapes of these elementary mountains are each
characteristic of the erosive agents which produced them, and that
each surface has marks which may be recognized in those lines of
profile which recur within the landscape&mdash;the
character profiles. In
the subdivision of the larger mass&mdash;the
<i>genetical</i> mountain&mdash;to form
the numerous smaller masses&mdash;the
<i>erosional</i> or <i>circumvallational</i> mountains&mdash;there
is disclosed a pattern
of fractures which has guided the
erosional agents in their incisional
operations (see Chapter XVII). In
high altitudes, where the action of
frost is so potent in prying at the
wider fractures, this subdivision of the mass may be revealed by
the sculpturing of squared towers or battlements (<a href="#f484">Fig. 484</a>).</p>

     <div class="caption"><p class="pc400"><span class="smcap">Fig. 485.</span>&mdash;Symmetrically formed low islands repeated in ranks upon Temagami
Lake, Ontario.</p>
</div></div>

<p>For other examples in which the sculptured surface is largely
the handiwork of a single erosional agent, as over vast areas in the
Canadian wilderness, the revelation of the fracture design is no
less apparent. Here a series of crystalline rocks underlie broad
expanses of territory and are without noteworthy variations of
hardness and almost bare of surface débris. Sculptured beneath a
mantling ice sheet, excavation has naturally been concentrated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[446]</a></span>
above the more widely gaping fissures of the joint-fault system,
doubtless already marked out in the river network which the
glacier overrode. The result has been a division of the surface
into a series of low, oval ridges or hummocks, which over vast areas
are repeated with monotonous regularity. Wherever the lower
levels have been flooded, symmetrical low islands of nearly uniform
elevation rise from the expanse of water and may be counted
by thousands. Though the smaller islands have notably regular
shore lines, the larger ones disclose their composition from smaller
units by the breaking of their shores into similar bays spaced with
regular intervals (<a href="#f485">Fig. 485</a>, and <a href="#f243">Figs. 243</a> and <a href="#f245">245</a>, <a href="#Page_229">p. 229</a>).</p>

<p>The ever repeating fracture design of the earth’s crust is not
restricted to the mountain masses which it has broken up, and the
unity of which it has done so much to conceal. It extends far
outside the margin of these masses, and is in fact common to whole
continents and perhaps even to the planet as a whole. The part
played by this design of fractures in the control of the sculpture
of landscapes it would be hard to overestimate. Through its
influence the striking features molded by one agent have been
merged in the contrasted shapes developed by another. It is the
great outline blender in the creation of nature’s masterpieces of
form and color. Thus the lines of this mysterious fracture network,
though stamped in indelible characters upon our landscapes,
are generally lost in the ensemble effect and may long remain undiscovered.
Like a moss-grown inscription upon a slab of marble,
though veiled, it may yet be deciphered; and if the veil be withdrawn,
the runic characters are disclosed, and one of nature’s laws
lies open before us.</p>

<h2 class="p4">APPENDIX A</h2>

<p class="pch">THE QUICK DETERMINATION OF THE COMMON MINERALS</p>

<p>Before one may gain a knowledge of rocks or the architecture of their
arrangement within the earth’s crust, it is quite essential that some familiarity
should be acquired with the appearance and properties of the
commonest minerals, and particularly those which enter as essential
constituents into the more abundant rocks. To be a competent mineralogist,
one must have a rather extended knowledge both of inorganic chemistry
and of the science of crystallography, which, fascinating as it is to
study, involves some technical knowledge of mathematics and much
laboratory experience. Though necessary to any one who contemplates
making a career as a geologist, this special study is not essential to a
cultural course like the present one. The attempt will here be made to
bring together a body of fact, from the study of which the student may
quickly learn to recognize the commonest minerals in their usual varieties.
The tests he is to apply are mainly physical, and in place of an
elaborate discussion of crystal symmetry, pictures only can be supplied.</p>

<p>To the beginner the usual textbook of mineralogy is difficult to read
intelligently, for the reason that for each mineral species it sets before him
a catalogue of each physical property in its turn, with little indication of
those data which in the individual case have special diagnostic value.
None the less, however, the student is advised to consider the several
properties of each mineral in a definite order, and the following may serve
as well as any: crystal or other form, cleavage, fracture, luster, color,
streak, transparency, tenacity, hardness, magnetism, and specific gravity.
In endeavoring to connect the specific values of these properties with
individual mineral species, the chemical composition and the manner of
occurrence are not to be forgotten. It is well for the student to be
supplied with a small pocket lens and with a pocket knife the blade of
which has been magnetized.</p>

<p><b>Crystal form.</b>&mdash;Some mineral species generally occur in more or less
definite crystals&mdash;are bounded by definite plane surfaces developed when
the mineral was formed; others in groups of interfering crystals or aggregates,
in which case the mineral is said to be crystalline; while still others
are rarely found crystallized at all. Thus in a given case crystal form
may, or may not, be important for the diagnosis of the substance. If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[450]</a></span>
a mineral species is usually to be found in crystals, the student should
be aware of the fact, and if possible should have a mental picture of the
common crystal shape or shapes. Without an extended knowledge of
crystallography, this must be supplied him by drawings. Since crystals
of most species are apt to be distorted, owing to the fact that some
planes within the same group appear upon the crystal with a larger development
than others, it is convenient to remember that markings, such
as lines or etchings upon the crystal faces, are the same throughout the
same group of planes, and in the text figures such groups of planes are
indicated by the use of a common letter. For crystalline aggregates
such terms as fibrous, radiating, massive, or granular have their usual
meanings.</p>

<p><b>Cleavage.</b>&mdash;It is characteristic of most crystals that they break or
<i>cleave</i> along certain directions so as to leave plane or nearly plane surfaces,
and the luster of the cleaved surface measures the perfection of the cleavage
property. It is important always to note how many such directions
of cleavage are present, and, roughly at least, at what angles they intersect&mdash;whether
they are perpendicular to each other or inclined at some
other angle. Further, it should be noted whether a given cleavage is
<i>perfect</i>, that is, easy, which will be indicated by the thinness of the plates
which can be secured. An extremely perfect cleavage is possessed by
the mineral mica, whose plates are thinner than the thinnest paper. In
the case of imperfect or interrupted cleavage, the fracture surfaces are
not plane throughout, but interrupted, the surface “jumping” from one
plane to a neighboring parallel one. It is especially important to note
whether, in the case of several cleavages possessed by a crystal, all have
the same degree of perfection, or whether they exhibit differences.</p>

<p><b>Fracture.</b>&mdash;In minerals with poorly developed cleavage, the fracture
surface is described as <i>fracture</i>. Fracture is thus perfect in proportion
as cleavage is imperfect. The fracture is described as conchoidal
when it shows waving spherical surfaces like broken glass. For
fine aggregates the fracture is described as even, uneven, earthy, etc.,
names which are generally intelligible.</p>

<p><b>Luster.</b>&mdash;This term is applied especially to the manner in which light
is reflected from mineral surfaces. The most important distinction
is made between those minerals which have a <i>metallic</i> luster and those
which have not, the former being always opaque. Other characteristic
lusters are adamantine (like oiled glass), vitreous (glassy), resinous,
waxy, etc.</p>

<p><b>Color.</b>&mdash;For minerals which possess metallic luster the color is always
practically the same, and hence it becomes a valuable diagnostic property.
Of minerals which have nonmetallic luster, the color may be always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[451]</a></span>
the same and hence characteristic, but in the case of many minerals it
ranges between wide limits and sometimes runs almost the entire gamut
of hues, yet without appreciable changes in the chemical composition of
the mineral.</p>


<p><b>Streak.</b>&mdash;This term is applied to the color of the mineral powder,
and is usually fairly constant, even when the surface color of different
specimens may vary within wide limits. In the case of fairly soft minerals
the streak is best examined by making a mark on a piece of unglazed
porcelain (streak stone).</p>


<p><b>Transparency</b> (<b>diaphaneity</b>).&mdash;The terms “transparent”, “translucent”,
“subtranslucent”, and “opaque” are used to describe decreasing grades
of permeability by light rays. Through transparent bodies print may
be read, while translucent bodies allow the light to be transmitted in
considerable quantity through them, though without rendering the image
of objects.</p>


<p><b>Tenacity.</b>&mdash;This comprehensive term includes such properties as
brittleness, flexibility, elasticity, malleability, etc.</p>


<p><b>Hardness.</b>&mdash;Quite erroneous notions are held concerning the meaning
of this very common word, which properly implies a resistance offered
to abrasion. It is one of the most valuable properties for the quick determination
of minerals, since minerals range from diamond upon the one
hand&mdash;the hardest of substances&mdash;to talc and graphite, which are so
soft as to be deeply scratched by the thumb nail. For practical purposes
it is sufficient to make use of a rough scale of hardness made up
from common or well-known minerals. If we exclude the gem minerals,
this scale need include but seven numbers, which are: talc, 1; gypsum, 2;
calcite, 3; fluor spar, 4; apatite, 5; feldspar, 6; and quartz, 7. A given
mineral is softer than a mineral in the scale when it can be visibly scratched
by a scale mineral, but will not leave a scratch when the conditions are
reversed. If each will scratch the other with equal readiness, the two
minerals have the same hardness.</p>

<p>Since it may often be desirable to test mineral hardness when no scale
is at hand, the following substitutes may be made use of: 1, greasy feel
and easily scratched by the thumb nail; 2, takes a scratch from the thumb
nail, but much less readily; 3, scratched by a copper coin and very
easily by a pocket knife; 4, scratched without difficulty by a knife;
5, scratched with difficulty by a knife, but easily by window glass;
6, scratched by window glass; 7, scratches window glass with readiness,
but a grain of sand may be substituted to represent quartz in the scale.</p>


<p><b>Magnetism.</b>&mdash;Though nearly all minerals which contain important
quantities of the elements iron, cobalt, or nickel may be attracted to a
strong electromagnet, there are but two common minerals, and these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[452]</a></span>
of widely different appearance, whose powder is lifted by a common
magnet. Others are, however, lifted after strong heating in the air
(<i>ignition</i>), and this is a valuable test.</p>

<p><b>Specific gravity.</b>&mdash;Rough tests of relative weight, or specific gravity,
may be made by lifting fair-sized specimens in the hand. Better determinations
require the use of a spring balance.</p>

<p><b>Treatment with acid.</b>&mdash;The carbonate minerals react with warm
and dilute mineral acid so as to give a boiling effect (effervescence),
since carbonic acid gas escapes into the air in the process.</p>

<p class="pch">PROPERTIES OF THE COMMON MINERALS</p>

<p>The more important common minerals fall into two classes according
as they have large economic importance as ores, or enter in an important
way into the composition of rocks.</p>

<h3>I. The Minerals of Economic Importance</h3>

<p><b>Hematite.</b>&mdash;The sesquioxide of iron, Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, and by far the most important
ore of iron. Rarely in good crystals, but sometimes in thin opaque
scales bearing some resemblance to mica and known as micaceous or
specular iron ore. At other times in nodules built up from radial needles
(needle ore); in hard masses mixed with fine quartz grains (hard hematite);
or in soft reddish brown earth (soft hematite). Color, black to
cherry red. The powdered mineral always cherry red or reddish brown,
and easily lifted by the magnet after ignition. Hardness 5.5-6.5;
specific gravity 5.</p>

<p><b>Magnetite.</b>&mdash;The magnetic oxide of iron, Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, often in crystals like
<a href="#f486">Fig. 486</a>, <sup>1-2</sup>. Black and opaque with a metallic luster. Streak black.
Lifted by a magnet and sometimes itself capable of lifting filings of
soft iron (lodestone). Hardness 5.5-6.5. Specific gravity 5.</p>

<p><b>Limonite.</b>&mdash;The most abundant and most valuable of the hydrated
iron ores, 2 Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. 3 H<sub>2</sub>O. Chemical composition the same as iron rust,
with which in the earthy form it is identical. Never in crystals, but often
in mammillary or rounded pendant forms resembling icicles, or sometimes
clusters of grapes. Its yellow (rust) streak is its best diagnostic
property. Ignited it gives off water and becomes magnetic. The streak
and its notably lower specific gravity distinguish it from certain forms of
hematite which it outwardly resembles. Hardness 5-5.5. Specific
gravity 3.6-4.</p>

<p><b>Pyrite, iron pyrites, or “fool’s gold.”</b>&mdash;The sulphide of iron, FeS<sub>2</sub>.
The most widely distributed sulphide mineral and now a chief source of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[453]</a></span>
the great chemical reagent, sulphuric acid or vitriol. Often, but not always,
in crystals (<a href="#f486">Fig. 486</a>, <sup>3-5</sup>) which have peculiar striæ upon their
faces. At other times the mineral is found massive or in radiated needles.
Bright metallic luster with the color of new brass, though often tarnished
or altered upon the surface to limonite. Hard and brittle, and so distinguished
from gold, which is soft and malleable and of the color of the
paler old brass (which contained a larger percentage of zinc). Gold is,
further, about four times as heavy as pyrite. Hardness 6-6.5. Specific
gravity 5.</p>

<p><b>Chalcopyrite, copper pyrites.</b>&mdash;A mixed sulphide of copper and iron.
If in crystals, like <a href="#f486">Fig. 486</a>, <sup>6</sup>; otherwise massive or compact. Luster metallic.
Color orange-yellow, often with local blue and green iridescence
like a pigeon’s throat. Distinguished from pyrite by the deeper color
and lower hardness, and from gold, particularly, by its brittleness and
lower specific gravity. Hardness 3.5-4. Specific gravity 4.</p>

<p><b>Galenite, galena.</b>&mdash;Sulphide of lead, PbS. The chief ore of lead, and,
from admixture of a silver mineral, of silver as well. Usually found in
crystals (<a href="#f486">Fig. 486</a>, <sup>7</sup>). Always cleaves into blocks bounded by six very
perfect rectangular faces which, when freshly broken, show a bright silvery
luster and quickly tarnish to a peculiarly “leaden” surface. Very
heavy. Color and streak lead-gray. Hardness 2.5. Specific gravity 7.5.</p>

<p><b>Sphalerite, zinc blende.</b>&mdash;Sulphide of zinc, ZnS, usually with considerable
admixture of sulphide of iron. The great ore of zinc. Not infrequently
in crystals (<a href="#f486">Fig. 486</a>, <sup>8-9</sup>), but more often in cleavable crystalline
aggregates. The cleavage in fine aggregates is sometimes difficult to
make out, but in coarse-grained masses it is seen to be equally and highly
perfect in six different directions, so that a symmetrical twelve-faced form
may sometimes be broken out (dodecahedron). Luster like that of rosin
(rosin jack), though when with large iron admixture the color may approach
black (black jack). The lighter colored varieties are translucent. Hardness
3.5-4. Specific gravity 4.</p>

<p><b>Malachite.</b>&mdash;Hydrated (basic) copper carbonate. The green copper
ore and the common surface alteration product of other copper minerals.
Usually has a microscopic structure made up of fine needle-like crystals,
but generally massive in various imitative shapes not unlike those of the
iron ores. Sometimes earthy. Its color is bright green, and it is usually
found in association with other characteristic copper ores, such as chalcopyrite
and azurite. When relatively pure and in large masses, it is
a beautiful ornamental stone. Effervesces with acid. Hardness 3.5-4.
Specific gravity 4.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[455]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Azurite.</b>&mdash;Hydrated (basic) copper carbonate, less hydrated than
malachite, and known as the blue carbonate of copper. Generally in
very minute and quite complex crystals, but also in imitative shapes
similar to those of malachite, and at other times earthy. Slightly lighter
in weight than malachite, from which it is easily distinguished, as from
most other minerals, by its bright azure blue color and its somewhat
lighter blue streak. Effervesces with nitric acid. Hardness 3.5-4.
Specific gravity 3.7-3.8.</p>

<p><b>Calcite.</b>&mdash;Calcium carbonate, CaCO<sub>3</sub>. Almost always in crystals (<a href="#f486">Fig. 486</a>,
<sup>10-13</sup>), or in confused crystal aggregates, though rarely fibrous or
dull and earthy. Some of the forms of the crystals are described as
“dog-tooth spar”, others as “nail-head spar”, while still others are modified
hexagonal prisms. There is a beautifully perfect cleavage of the
mineral along three directions which make angles of about 105° with each
other, so that under the hammer the substance breaks into blocks which
are shaped like the crystal of <a href="#f486">Fig. 486</a>, <sup>10</sup>. Usually white or gray, but
occasionally faintly tinted. Streak white. Effervesces with cold and
dilute mineral acids. An associate of many ores and the chief mineral
of limestone. A similar mineral&mdash;dolomite&mdash;contains in addition magnesium
carbonate, has simpler crystals (like the drawing of <a href="#f486">Fig. 486</a>, <sup>10</sup>,
but often with rounded faces), and effervesces only when the acid is warmed.
Hardness 3. Specific gravity 2.7.</p>

<p><b>Gypsum.</b>&mdash;Hydrated calcium sulphate, CaSO<sub>4</sub>.2 H<sub>2</sub>O, and the source
of plaster of Paris. Often in simple crystals (<a href="#f487">Fig. 487</a>, <sup>1</sup>) or else “swallow
tail”, like <a href="#f487">Fig. 487</a>, <sup>2</sup>; in which case the mineral is generally either
transparent or translucent and is described as selenite. Such crystals
show a cleavage approaching in perfection that of the micas, but, unlike
the mica laminæ, those produced by cleavage in gypsum though flexible
are not elastic. There are also fibrous forms of gypsum (satin spar),
a fine-grained form (alabaster), and the impure earthy form (rock gypsum).
Very soft, light in weight, and difficultly fusible. Color usually
white, gray, or pale yellow. Hardness 2. Specific gravity 2.3.</p>

<p><b>Copper glance.</b>&mdash;A sulphide of copper, Cu<sub>2</sub>S. Not usually well crystallized,
but generally massive and associated or variously admixed with
other copper ores such as chalcopyrite, malachite, etc. Fracture conchoidal,
luster metallic, color and streak blackish lead-gray, though often
tarnished blue or green from surface alterations to the copper carbonates.
Softer and heavier than chalcopyrite. Blowpipe or chemical tests are necessary
for its identification. Hardness 2.5-3. Specific gravity 5.5-5.8.</p>

<p><b>Cerussite.</b>&mdash;The white or carbonate lead ore, PbCO<sub>3</sub>, and an important
ore of silver as well. Often in crystals of considerable complexity, though
<a href="#f487">Fig. 487</a>, <sup>3-4</sup>, shows some common shapes. Often granular, massive, or
earthy (gray carbonate ore). Very brittle and with conchoidal fracture.
The luster is adamantine or like that of oiled glass. Color generally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[456]</a></span>
white or gray. Very heavy, the heaviest of light colored and nonmetallic
minerals. Dissolves in nitric acid with effervescence. Hardness 3-3.5.
Specific gravity 6.5.</p>

<p><b>Siderite.</b>&mdash;The carbonate or “spathic” ore of iron, FeCO<sub>3</sub>. Either
in crystals resembling in form <a href="#f486">Fig. 486</a>, <sup>10</sup>, but with rounded faces, or
cleavable massive to finely granular and earthy. The crystalline varieties
cleave easily into smaller blocks of the same form as those of calcite. Color
usually gray or brown and streak white. On strongly igniting, the white
powder becomes black and magnetic. Lighter in both color and weight
than the other iron ores, and unlike them siderite effervesces with acid.
Distinguished from calcite by its higher specific gravity and its change
upon being ignited. Hardness 3.5-4. Specific gravity 3.9.</p>

<p><b>Smithsonite.</b>&mdash;Carbonate of zinc, ZnCO<sub>3</sub>, and an important ore of
that metal. Seldom found in crystals except as a replacement of calcite
crystals, in which case it shows the forms characteristic of the latter mineral.
Usually kidney-shaped, stalactitic, or else in incrustations upon
other minerals. Sometimes granular or earthy. Brittle. Luster vitreous,
color white or greenish gray, though often stained yellow with iron
rust. Streak white except when the mineral is stained with iron. Effervesces
with warm acid. Hardness 5. Specific gravity 4.4.</p>

<p><b>Pyrolusite.</b>&mdash;Black oxide of manganese, MnO<sub>2</sub>, though generally impure
from admixture with other manganese oxides. Usually in intricate
aggregates which may be columnar, fibrous, mammillary, earthy, etc.
Opaque, with color and streak both black. Soft and easily soils the fingers.
With hydrochloric acid gives off the choking fumes of chlorine. Hardness
2-2.5. Specific gravity 4.8.</p>

<h3>II. The Minerals important as Rock Makers</h3>

<p>These minerals are in most cases complex silicates of one or more of a
certain number of metals such as aluminium, calcium, magnesium, iron,
sodium, potassium, or hydroxyl (OH). For their identification an examination
of the physical properties is usually sufficient, whereas of the
typical ore minerals already considered, additional chemical tests may be
necessary.</p>

<p><b>Feldspars.</b>&mdash;A group of similar alumino-silicates of potassium, sodium,
and calcium. The most important of all rock-making minerals. Although
with wide variation in chemical composition, the feldspars are yet broadly
divided into two classes; the one striated, and the other an unstriated
potash or orthoclase variety. The pocket lens is usually necessary in order
to make out the striations upon the crystal or cleavage surfaces. When
formed in veins, feldspar appears in crystals (<a href="#f487">Fig. 487</a>, <sup>5-6</sup>), but as a rock
constituent the mutual interference of crystals prevents the development
of bounding faces. Two cleavage directions, nearly or quite perpendicular
to each other, are notably different in their perfection. Hard enough
to scratch glass, but easily scratched by sand. Color pink (usually orthoclase
or microline), white (often albite) to gray. Sometimes with beautiful
“pigeon’s throat” effect of iridescence (labradorite). Low specific
gravity. Hardness 6. Specific gravity 2.5-2.8.</p>

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[458]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Quartz.</b>&mdash;Oxide of silicon or silica, SiO<sub>2</sub>. Both an important vein
mineral associated with the ores and a rock maker. In the former case
particularly, often in crystals of notably simple forms (<a href="#f487">Fig. 487</a>, <sup>7</sup>). Few
minerals which are not gems are so hard. Remarkable freedom from
cleavage so that the mineral breaks much like window glass&mdash;conchoidal
fracture. Wide range in both transparency and color. Transparent and
colorless crystalline variety (rock crystal), brown translucent (smoky
quartz), turbid white (milky quartz), and various colored varieties (carnelian,
jasper, jet, etc.). Insoluble in acids and infusible. Hardness 7.
Specific gravity 2.6.</p>

<p><b>Micas.</b>&mdash;Like the feldspars a group of complex silicates, but here
chiefly of potassium, magnesium, iron, and hydroxyl. Abundant as rock
makers, the micas are all characterized by the thinnest and toughest
of elastic cleavage plates, such as are generally known as isinglass. When
a needle is driven sharply through a thin scale of mica, a six-rayed puncture
star forms about the needle point. The darker common variety of
mica is rich in iron and magnesium and is called biotite, and the lighter
colored alkaline variety, muscovite. Hardness 2.5-3.1. Specific gravity
2.7-3.1.</p>

<p><b>Chlorite.</b>&mdash;Generally an intricate mixture of more or less similar
microscopic crystals having varying and rather complex chemical compositions
and related to the micas, but all characterized by a peculiar leaf
green color. These minerals are a common product of hydration weathering
in rocks which are rich in magnesium and iron&mdash;especially those that
contain biotite, pyroxene, or hornblende (see below). Hardness 1-2.5.
Specific gravity 2.5-3.</p>

<p><b>Pyroxenes.</b>&mdash;An important group of related rock-making minerals all
of which are silicates of the bases magnesium, calcium, aluminium, iron,
and manganese. Quite generally developed either in columnar or needle-like
crystals which are uniformly shaped in cross section like <a href="#f487">Fig. 487</a>, <sup>8</sup>.
Two rather imperfect cleavages are directed parallel to the longer axis
of the crystal and nearly at right angles to each other. The colors of all
but the lime varieties are dark and generally green, dark brown, bronze,
or black. The lime varieties are white, gray, or pale green. A dark
colored and common iron variety is known as augite. Streak generally
either white or lightly tinted. Hardness 5-6. Specific gravity 3.2-3.6.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[459]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Amphiboles.</b>&mdash;A group of minerals of the same chemical composition
as the pyroxenes, with which also in most physical properties they agree.
The principal distinction is found in the shape of the cross section and in
the cleavage (<a href="#f487">Fig. 487</a>, <sup>9</sup>). Whereas the cross sections of pyroxenes are
generally eight sided, those of the amphiboles have six sides, and whereas
the cleavage directions of pyroxenes are nearly at right angles to each
other (87°), the similar but much more perfect cleavage directions of
the amphiboles are inclined at an obtuse angle (124½°). Owing to the
obliquity of the amphibole cleavage, fractured surfaces of the mineral
appear splintery, which is not in the same measure true of the pyroxenes.
A fibrous variety of amphibole, and occasionally other varieties of the
mineral, is a not uncommon product of weathering of pyroxenes. Other
physical properties of the amphiboles are in the main almost identical with
those of the pyroxenes.</p>

<p><b>Garnet.</b>&mdash;Complex alumino-silicates or ferro-silicates of calcium,
magnesium, iron, or manganese, or several of these combined. Nearly
always in crystals, and usually found in mica schist (see below). The
crystals usually have twelve similar faces, each a lozenge (dodecahedron),
or else twenty-four similar faces, or the two forms combined (<a href="#f487">Fig. 487</a>,
<sup>10</sup>). Brittle. From any but the gem minerals garnet is easily
distinguished by its hardness, which in different varieties ranges from
somewhat below to somewhat above that of quartz. The luster is vitreous,
and the color runs the gamut of reds, browns, and greens, but with
the common hue dark red to black. Streak white. Hardness 6.5-7.5.
Specific gravity 3.1-4.3.</p>

<p><b>Nephelite</b> (<b>nephelene</b>).&mdash;An alumino-silicate of sodium and potassium.
In certain special provinces this mineral is developed in abundance as an
essential constituent of igneous rocks, but elsewhere practically unknown.
The rare crystals are hexagonal prisms (<a href="#f487">Fig. 487</a>, <sup>11</sup>), but the mineral is most
easily determined by its general resemblance to feldspar, but with the differences
of cleavage, luster, and reaction with acid. Whereas the feldspars
have two cleavages, either nearly or quite perpendicular to each other
and of different degrees of perfection, nephelite has three equal cleavages
inclined 60° and 120° to each other and of less perfection than either
feldspar cleavage. The luster of nephelite is perhaps the best clew
to its identity, since this is greasy and simulated by but few minerals.
The fine powder of the mineral treated for some time with strong hydrochloric
acid forms a perfect jelly of silicic acid, whereas the feldspars
do not. Though itself gray or white and unobtrusive, nephelite
is usually associated with brightly colored minerals, which are often the
first clew to its presence in a rock. Hardness 5.5-6. Specific gravity
2.5-2.6.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[460]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Talc</b> (<b>soapstone</b>).&mdash;A silicate of magnesium and hydroxyl which is
an important alteration product through weathering of certain pyroxene
rocks especially. Usually a foliated mass, this product is occasionally
fibrous or even granular. Talc is one of the softest of minerals, having a
greasy feel and being easily scratched with the thumb nail. The luster
of the foliated varieties is apt to be pearly, and the color apple-green to
white, though sometimes stained brown from oxide of iron. The streak
of the mineral is white except when stained by iron. Although the
rocks which are composed mainly of talc (soapstone) are exceedingly
soft, they are very tough and remarkably resistant. Hardness 1-1.5.
Specific gravity 2.7-2.8.</p>

<p><b>Serpentine.</b>&mdash;Like talc, serpentine is a silicate of magnesium and
hydroxyl, and an important product of the breaking down of magnesium
minerals in the process of weathering. The mineral is usually found as a
fine web of microscopic needle-like fibers, and is best roughly diagnosed
by its color and its associated minerals. Like talc it is usually developed
within those igneous rocks from which feldspar is lacking, but where either
pyroxene or olivine is found in abundance or was previous to alteration.
The characteristic color of serpentine is leek-green. The rock largely
composed of serpentine is called by the same name, and being exceedingly
tough and unchanging is, in spite of its softness, a valuable building and
ornamental stone. A red magnesium garnet is apt to be associated with
such serpentine masses. Hardness 2.5-4, because of impurities. Specific
gravity 2.5-2.6.</p>

<p><b>Staurolite.</b>&mdash;A silicate of aluminium, iron, and hydroxyl. Found in
metamorphic rocks usually in association with garnet. Always in crystals
bounded by simple forms generally crossed, as shown in <a href="#f487">Fig. 487</a>, <sup>12-14</sup>.
The color is dark reddish brown, and the streak is colorless to grayish.
The hardness is exceptional and higher than that of quartz. Hardness
7-7.5. Specific gravity 3.6-3.7.</p>

<p><b>Tourmaline.</b>&mdash;An exceptionally complex silicate of boron and aluminium
as well as iron, magnesium, and the alkalies. Found in metamorphic
rocks and always crystallized. The crystals are columns or needles
whose cross section is the best guide to their identity, since this is a modified
triangle unlike that of any other mineral (<a href="#f487">Fig. 487</a>, <sup>15-16</sup>). Additional
diagnostic properties are the characteristic striations which run lengthwise
of the crystals upon prism faces, and the lack of any cleavage (difference
from hornblende). The hardness is also a valuable property, since this
is greater than that of quartz. The mineral is brittle and the fracture
subconchoidal. The range in color is as great as, or greater than, that of
garnet, though the common forms are jet black. Streak uncolored.
Hardness 7-7.5. Specific gravity 3-3.2.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[461]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Olivine.</b>&mdash;A silicate of magnesium and iron and a rock-making mineral
found only in those igneous rocks which have little or no feldspar.
It easily suffers alteration by weathering and passes into serpentine, and
in fact is seldom found except when at least partially altered to the fibrous
webs of that mineral. The form of the unaltered crystals within the
rocks is shown in <a href="#f487">Fig. 487</a>, <sup>17</sup>, and, cut in sections, the mineral appears
in more or less elongated hexagons. The hardness of the unaltered mineral
is about that of quartz. It has rather imperfect cleavages in two
rectangular directions, and is usually translucent, with a vitreous luster
and a color which is olive-green when not stained brown by oxide of
iron. Streak uncolored. Hardness 6.5-7. Specific gravity 3.2-3.3.</p>

<h2 class="p4">APPENDIX B</h2>

<p class="pch">SHORT DESCRIPTIONS OF SOME COMMON ROCKS</p>

<p>In Chapter IV the classification and the structure of rocks have been
briefly discussed. Below are added brief descriptions of the more important
common rocks. For rocks as for minerals it is, however, essential
that a collection of well-chosen specimens be studied for purposes of
comparison. A small pocket lens is a valuable aid in making out the
component minerals and the textures of the finer grained rocks.</p>

<h3>1. Intrusive Rocks</h3>

<p><b>Granite.</b>&mdash;Of granitic texture, though sometimes porphyritic as well.
The most abundant mineral constituent is a pink or white feldspar, usually
without visible striations, with which there is usually in subordinate
quantity a white striated feldspar. Next in importance to the feldspar
is quartz, which because of its lack of cleavage shows a peculiar gray
surface resembling wet sugar. In addition to feldspar and quartz there is
generally, though not universally, a dark colored mineral, either mica or
hornblende. The mica is usually biotite, though often associated with
muscovite.</p>

<p><b>Syenite.</b>&mdash;Like granite, but without quartz, with more striated feldspar,
and generally also the rock has a darker average tint. While biotite
is the commonest dark colored constituent of granite, hornblende is more
apt to take its place in syenite. Less common than granite, to which it is
closely related in origin and in composition.</p>

<p><b>Gabbro.</b>&mdash;A dark colored rock of granitic texture composed of striated
feldspar with broad cleavage surfaces and usually an abundance of pyroxene.
In contrast to the feldspars of granite, those of gabbroes are often
dull and colored grayish yellow or greenish. The pyroxene is often in
part changed to fibrous amphibole. Magnetite may be an abundant
accessory mineral.</p>

<p><b>Diabase.</b>&mdash;In color dark like gabbro, and of similar constitution. In
diabase, however, the feldspar crystals, instead of being broad and of
irregularly interrupted outline, are relatively long (“lath-shaped”), and
the pyroxene acts as a filler of the residual space between them.</p>

<p><b>Peridotite.</b>&mdash;A heavy and dark colored rock of granitic texture which
is nearly or quite devoid of feldspar but contains olivine. When altered,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[463]</a></span>
as it generally is, it is largely a mass of serpentine, talc, and chlorite, surrounding
cores, it may be, of still unaltered pyroxene and olivine. Magnetite
is an abundant constituent, and a red garnet is apt to be present.</p>

<h3>2. Extrusive Rocks</h3>

<p><b>Obsidian.</b>&mdash;A rock glass rich in silica. It is usually black and breaks
with a perfect conchoidal fracture. It often passes over through insensible
gradations into pumice, which differs only in its vesicular structure.
As regards chemical composition, obsidian and pumice are not notably
different from rhyolite (below).</p>

<p><b>Rhyolite.</b>&mdash;A light colored rock of porphyritic texture, often also with
fluxion or spherulitic textures, or both combined. The porphyritic appearance
is given the rock by large crystals of a glassy, unstriated feldspar
and crystals of quartz. Rhyolite is a very siliceous lava containing rather
more silica than granite, to which of the intrusive rocks it is most closely
related, and from which it differs in its texture and in the manner of its
occurrence in nature. Whereas granite is found in great batholites,
laccolites, and bysmalites, and consolidated in most cases beneath the
earth’s surface, rhyolite generally occurs in sheets, flows, or dikes, and
consolidated either above or in fissures near to the surface.</p>

<p><b>Trachyte.</b>&mdash;Similar to rhyolite, but usually with a peculiar gray aspect
from the greater abundance of feldspar crystals. The rock is less siliceous
than rhyolite, contains no quartz crystals, and approaches a feldspar
in its average composition.</p>

<p><b>Andesite.</b>&mdash;Similar to rhyolite in appearance and in origin, but more
basic and correspondingly dark in color. The porphyritic crystals are of
lath-shaped, striated feldspar, with which are associated crystals of either
biotite or hornblende or both. A fluxion texture is particularly characteristic
of this type of extrusive rock.</p>

<p><b>Basalt.</b>&mdash;A dark colored or black basic rock of porphyritic texture
which differs but little from diabase. It may show under the lens fine
lath-shaped crystals of striated feldspar associated with crystals of augite,
but more frequently the rock is dense and without visible mineral constituents.
It is particularly likely to occur divided up into columns six
inches to a foot in diameter and known as basaltic columns. Especially
fine examples are known from the Giant’s Causeway and other localities
in the western British Isles.</p>

<h3>3. Sedimentary Rocks of Mechanical Origin</h3>

<p><b>Conglomerate</b> (“<b>pudding stone</b>”).&mdash;A rock made up from pebbles
which are cemented together with sand and finer materials. The pebbles
are usually worn by work of the waves upon a shore, and may vary in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[464]</a></span>
size from a pea to large bowlders. They may consist of almost any hard
mineral or rock, though the sand about them is largely quartz.</p>

<p><b>Sandstone.</b>&mdash;A rock composed of sand cemented together either by
calcareous, siliceous, or ferruginous materials. Sandstones are described
as friable when their surface grains are easily rubbed off, or as compact
when they are more firmly cemented. Sandstones are often distinctly
banded and are sometimes variously stained with oxide of iron. Those
sandstones which have been formed upon a seacoast are known as marine
sandstones, while those derived from accumulations collected by the wind
in deserts are distinguished as continental deposits. Sandstones form
much thicker formations than conglomerates, the latter usually constituting
a basal layer only of the sandstone formation (basal conglomerate).</p>

<p><b>Shale.</b>&mdash;A consolidated mud stone which is probably the most abundant
rock formation. In large part clay admixed in varying proportions
with extremely fine sandy grains.</p>

<h3>4. Sedimentary Rocks of Chemical Precipitation</h3>

<p><b>Calcareous tufa</b> (<b>travertine</b>).&mdash;Not to be confused with tuff, which
is a fragmental extrusive or volcanic rock. Calcareous tufa is formed
when waters which contain carbonic acid gas and lime carbonate in solution,
give off the gas and with it the power to hold the lime in solution.
Such a liberation of the gas may occur when the stream is dashed into
spray above a cascade, and the lime is then deposited about the site of the
falls. Travertine is generally porous and formed of more or less concentric
layers or incrustations. A remarkable illustration is furnished by the
travertine deposits of Tivoli and other localities near Rome, since here
the material supplies a valuable building stone.</p>

<p><b>Oölitic limestone</b> (<b>oolite</b>).&mdash;This rock is made up of spherical nodules
and so has the appearance of fish roe. Broken apart, each grain reveals
in its center a core of siliceous sand about which carbonate of lime has been
deposited in concentric layers. It is thought that waters charged with
carbonate of lime, in issuing from a river near a sea beach, coat the sand
grains of the latter with successive thin films of lime carbonate due to the
rhythmic ebb and flow of the tides, evaporation of the adhering water
taking place when the sands are exposed at low tide.</p>

<h3>5. Sedimentary Rocks of Organic Origin</h3>

<p><b>Limestone.</b>&mdash;A generally white or gray rock composed of carbonate
of lime with varying proportions of clay, silica, and other impurities. The
lime carbonate is usually derived from the hard parts of marine organisms,
and the argillaceous and siliceous impurities from the finer land-derived
sediments which descend with them to the bottom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[465]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Dolomite</b> (<b>dolomitic or magnesium limestone</b>).&mdash;Differs from limestone
in containing varying proportions of the mineral dolomite (<i>ante</i>,
<a href="#Page_455">p. 455</a>), which is made up of equal parts of calcium and magnesium carbonates.
Difficult to distinguish from limestone unless a chemical test
is made for magnesium, though it may be said in general that dolomite
is less soluble in cold mineral acids.</p>

<p><b>Peat.</b>&mdash;An accumulation of decomposed vegetable matter within
small lakes and in lagoons separated from larger ones (<i>ante</i>, <a href="#Page_429">p. 429</a>).
Peat represents the first stage in the formation of coal from vegetable matter,
and differs from the coals by its larger proportion of contained water.
Because of this water its fuel value is correspondingly small. It is usually
dark brown or black and reveals something of the structure of the
plants out of which it was formed.</p>

<h3>6. Metamorphic Rocks</h3>

<p><b>Gneiss.</b>&mdash;A generally more or less banded (gneissic) metamorphic
rock with a mineral constitution similar to granite, and often developed
by metamorphic processes from that rock. It may at other times, by processes
not essentially different, be derived from sedimentary formations.
It usually contains as important constituents unstriated feldspar and
quartz, but in addition it may include a striated feldspar, biotite, muscovite,
or hornblende, or several of these combined. In proportion as
mica or hornblende is abundant, it has a marked banded texture, but it
differs from mica schist (see below) not only in the presence of its feldspar,
but in the smaller proportion of mica. Biotite gneiss, hornblende gneiss,
etc., are terms used to designate varieties in which one or the other of the
dark colored constituents predominate.</p>

<p><b>Mica schist.</b>&mdash;A metamorphic rock without feldspar and mainly
composed of quartz and light colored mica (muscovite). The abundant
mica lends to the rock its characteristic schistose texture, which differs
from the usual gneissic texture. In some cases the mica is wrapped about
the grains of quartz, but at other times it forms a series of almost continuous
membranes separating layers of quartz.</p>

<p><b>Sericite schist.</b>&mdash;A variety of schist which is characterized by an
abundance of a peculiar silvery mica rich in the element group hydroxyl.
The mica scales are often microscopic and wrought into an intricate
web with the quartz constituent.</p>

<p><b>Talc schist.</b>&mdash;A schist made up largely of talc, but with varying
proportions of quartz, magnetite, etc. From the abundance of the talc
it is usually pale green or white.</p>

<p><b>Chlorite schist.</b>&mdash;A greenish, fine-grained metamorphic rock in which
chlorite is the principal mineral, but in which magnetite is a quite characteristic
accessory constituent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[466]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Staurolitic garnetiferous mica schist.</b>&mdash;A mica schist in which garnet
and staurolite are so abundant as to be essential constituents.</p>

<p><b>Clay slate.</b>&mdash;A metamorphosed mud stone or shale. In the process
of metamorphism the rock has been hardened, given a slaty cleavage,
and innumerable minute scales of mica have developed to produce a
silky luster upon the cleavage faces. The color may be gray, green,
purple, or black.</p>

<p><b>Quartzite.</b>&mdash;A metamorphosed sandstone in which the sand grains
have become enlarged by accretion of silica. Whereas a sandstone fractures
about its constituent grains, a break in quartzite is continued through
the grains and the cement alike. In contrast to sandstones, the quartzites
derived from them are usually lighter in color and often nearly white.</p>

<p><b>Marble</b> (<b>crystalline limestone</b>).&mdash;The result of metamorphism upon
limestones. Usually white in color but sometimes gray, blue gray, or
yellow, and sometimes variously broken or brecciated and stained with
iron oxide. Effervesces with cold dilute acid.</p>

<p><b>Coals.</b>&mdash;Under the head of peat the first stage in the formation of
coals from vegetable matter has been briefly described. Lignite, or
brown coal, represents a further stage and one in which the vegetable
structure is still recognizable. It is usually brownish black or black
in color and contains a considerable proportion of water. With increased
pressure or dynamic metamorphism, further percentages of the volatile
constituents are eliminated, and when from seventy-five to ninety
per cent of carbon remains, the material burns with a yellow flame and
is known as bituminous coal. This is the great fuel for the production
of steam. A continuation of the metamorphic processes carries off a
further proportion of the volatile matter and leaves a dense, hard, black
substance with sometimes as much as ninety-five per cent of carbon.
This is the so-called “hard coal” or anthracite generally used for fuel
in our houses, for which purpose it is so well adapted because it burns
with a production of much heat and almost without smoke.</p>

<h2 class="p4">APPENDIX C</h2>

<p class="pch">THE PREPARATION OF TOPOGRAPHICAL MAPS</p>

<p><b>Topographical maps a library of physiography.</b>&mdash;For the satisfactory
working out in detail of the geology of any region of complex structure,
an accurate topographical map is prerequisite. This is so much the more
true because nearly all complexly folded or faulted rock masses are to be
found in mountainous, or at least in hilly regions. The making of the
topographical map must, therefore, precede that of the geological map,
and in modern usage the latter is a topographical and a geological map
combined in one.</p>

<p>Within certain narrow limits, predictions concerning the geological
history of a province may often be made by an expert geologist from
examination of an accurate topographical map. Just as in forecasting
the weather upon the basis of the usual weather maps, such predictions
can sometimes be made with entire confidence in their accuracy, while
at other times a guess only may be hazarded. The great value of the
modern topographical map is becoming, however, universally acknowledged,
and every highly civilized nation has either completed or has in
preparation sectional topographical maps of its domain on such a scale
as is warranted by its financial condition and its state of development.
Thus there is now being accumulated a vast library of geographical and
to some extent geological information, of which the student of geology
must be prepared to make use.</p>

<p><b>The nature of a contour map.</b>&mdash;More and more the contour map is
replacing the earlier and less scientific methods of representing topography
on the large scale sectional maps, and hence this type only need
here be considered. In the contour map, the relief of the land is represented
by a series of curving lines, each the intersection of a particular
horizontal plane with the land surface, and the several planes separated
by uniform differences of elevation. This altitude interval is known as
the contour interval. Its choice is a matter of considerable importance,
for though regions of relatively simple topography may be adequately
represented upon a map of large contour interval, say one hundred feet,
another district may require an interval as short as five feet. A contour
map with this interval may be conceived to have been made by flooding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[468]</a></span>
the region which it represents and preparing maps of the shore lines for
each rise of five feet of the water surface, and superimposing the several
maps thus derived with accurate registration one above the other. Wherever
the land slopes are steep, the shore lines of the several maps will be
crowded closely together and give the effect of a relatively dark local
shade; where, upon the other hand, the surface is relatively flat, the
several shores will be widely spaced and the effect will be to produce a
white area upon the map. Thus in contour maps dark tones indicate
steep gradients and pale tones a flatness of surface.</p>

<p><b>The selection of scale and contour interval.</b>&mdash;With the use of the
small scale in the contour map, the tones of the map will be correspondingly
dark, though the relative differences in tone will remain the same.
With the use of a closer contour interval the tones will deepen throughout.
The adjustment of scale and contour interval to any given region is a
matter requiring experience in topographical mapping, and in addition
a knowledge of the geological significance of topographic features. Unfortunately,
the element of expense and the special commercial objects
held in view, conspire to select scales and contour intervals which are
often little adapted to the districts surveyed.</p>

<p><b>The method of preparing a topographical map.</b>&mdash;Having fixed upon
the scale and the contour interval which is to be employed, the task of
the topographical surveyor is next to fix accurately the positions and the
elevations of a sufficient number of points to <i>control</i> the map, and then
to hang, as it were, upon these points as attachments the design represented
by the relief. Were the surface of the ground to be represented
by a flexible fabric, the map maker might raise from a flat base a series of
stout posts of the heights and in the positions which he has determined,
and upon these supports arrange the slopes of the fabric much as drapery
is adjusted. The determination of the exact positions and the elevations
of his control stations is, therefore, a process coldly precise and formal;
whereas in the shaping of the surfaces his attention should be fixed
more upon correctly reproducing the shapes than upon fixing accurately
the position of every point. As a matter of fact, the position of the
average point will be most accurately fixed when the shapes of the features
are most clearly comprehended. To some extent, therefore, the
topographer should be familiar with the geological significance of the
earth features which he is representing.</p>

<p><b>Laboratory exercises in the preparation of topographical maps.</b>&mdash;The
principles which underlie the surveyor’s method for preparing a topographical
map may be learned in the laboratory by the use of models and
the simple device shown in plate 24 A and B. To represent the section
of country to be mapped a model in plaster of Paris is substituted, and this
is placed within a rectangular tank to which locating carriages and altitude
gauges are attached that allow the student to fix the position and the
elevation of any point upon the surface of the model.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[469]</a></span></p>

<p>Upon each model the student “locates”, or fixes, the position of a
sufficient number of points for the control of his map, entering upon an
appropriate map base for each position the altitude which was read from
the gauges. Now <i>with the map always before him</i> he “sketches in” the
forms of the surface by means of contour lines. For this purpose it
is often desirable to fix roughly the direction of the steepest slope at a
number of places, and noting the differences in elevation between control
stations, divide up the distance in accordance with the curves of slope
and start the contours at right angles to the slope. Afterwards such
sections are connected by sketching in with the model always in view
for control (<a href="#f488">Fig. 488</a>).</p>

apparatus represented in <a href="#p24a">plate 24 A</a>.</p>
</div></div>

<p><b>The verification of the map.</b>&mdash;The map prepared, its accuracy may
be tested by a simple method which is denied the topographer who has
to do with the actual surface of the ground. The locating carriages
and altitude gauges are removed from the tank, which is next filled with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[470]</a></span>
water and leveled by means of guide marks upon the interior. A few
drops of milk or of ordinary clothes blueing are added to the water to
render it opaque, and it is then drawn off at the faucet in successive installments,
so that the surface drops by layers corresponding in thickness
to the contour interval of the map, plate 24 B. As each layer is withdrawn,
that contour of the map to which the shore line should correspond
is carefully examined and corrected. By such corrections the nature of
the first errors made is soon appreciated, and the method of procedure
is thus more easily acquired. At the same time the significance of the
design of the map is more quickly learned than by a mere examination
of the standard government maps.</p>

<p>The work above outlined calls for waterproofed models of suitable
form and size, and a series, each of which sets forth some typical feature
or series of features, has been designed by Mr. Irving D. Scott.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p><b>The preparation of physiographic models.</b>&mdash;The apparatus used to
prepare the topographic map is adapted also for preparing a physiographic
model from a standard topographical map. For this purpose
the method is essentially reversed, though the tank is replaced to advantage
by a light metal frame elevated upon one side so as to permit a free
use of the hands in modeling the clay.</p>

<p>The material used in preparing the model is artists’ modeling clay<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
which has a base of beef suet, and hence does not dry out and crack as
does ordinary clay. Its form is, therefore, retained indefinitely, and it
may be used again and again. Most maps must be enlarged in modeling,
and the simplest way is often to photographically or by pantograph
enlarge the map to the scale of the model. The map prepared,
it is covered by a thin celluloid plate which has cut upon it a series of
crossed lines spaced in inches and larger subdivisions to correspond to
those of the locating carriages (<a href="#p24c">plate 24 C</a>).</p>

<p>The enlargement of the map is not essential to experienced workers,
and the standard map may be covered in similar manner by a transparent
plate with “checkerboard” design, the squares of which bear some
simple relation in size to the larger divisions of the locating carriages
(<a href="#p24c">Plate 24 C</a>, rear).</p>

<p>The method of preparing the model is comparatively simple. Beginning
at any point upon the map, the intersection of a heavy contour
line with one of the guide lines of the celluloid “position plate” is carefully
noted. Both the position and the elevation of this point are fixed by
the point of the altitude gauge of the modeling frame, and the clay built
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[471]</a></span>
up beneath it to that height. With the fingers the clay is now roughly
shaped in various directions from this point, the altitude gauge is advanced
by the locating carriage so as to correspond in position to the
intersection of the next heavy contour line with the same guide line of
the position plate, and the elevation for this point similarly adjusted
upon the model. As before, the surface of the clay is roughly shaped in
advance and upon the sides so as to conform to the indications of the
map; and this process is repeated until the work is finished. Corrections
for intermediate positions may be carried to any desired degree of
refinement which the scale and the accuracy of the map permit. Models
which are larger than the area of the modeling frame are prepared by
making a square foot at a time by the above described process, and then
moving the frame forward and adjusting in a new position by means
of the sharp pins in the legs of the apparatus.</p>

<p>The laboratory models which have been described on page 63, and are
used to represent outcrops in the study of geological maps, are shown
in <a href="#f489">Fig. 489</a>. The drum-shaped blocks serve to represent massive rocks
which occur in irregularly
shaped masses such as batholites
and flows. The long,
narrow strips are for intrusive
rocks in the form of
dikes, while the larger blocks
provided with a swivel joint
are used for outcrops of sedimentary rocks, and after adjustment they
give the dip and strike of the exposure. The wing bolts used in their
construction should be of bronze, because of the effect of iron upon the
compass. For the same reason tables should not be placed near iron
beams or columns. All these blocks can be made by an ordinary carpenter,
and should be available in sufficient numbers to arrange problems
like those of <a href="#f47">Figs. 47</a>, <a href="#f48">48</a>, and <a href="#f490">490</a>. With a view to supplying suggestions

<p class="pch">SUGGESTED ITINERARIES FOR PILGRIMAGES TO STUDY
EARTH FEATURES</p>

<p>The chief value of the laboratory studies discussed in the preceding
appendices is as a preparation for observations made in the field&mdash;the
laboratory <i>par excellence</i> of the geologist. The pilgrimages whose itineraries
are here suggested have been planned especially for impressing by
observation the lessons of this book. Such journeys are best interrupted
at a relatively small number of localities which, because already studied
in some detail, are specially adapted to serve as centers for local excursions.
These localities will in most cases be the great scenic places to which
tourists resort, or the seats of universities near which specially detailed
explorations have been often made.</p>

<p>Within the United States a few local geological guides have been published,
and the Geologic Folios published by the United States Geological
Survey are already available for a number of such centers. For one long
geological pilgrimage we are fortunate in having a carefully prepared
guide, namely, from New York to the Yellowstone National Park and
back, with a side trip to the Grand Cañon of the Colorado. Except for
the side trip this route, in large measure, corresponds with one here chosen,
and for the return journey especially the student is referred to it for information
(Geological Guide Book of the Rocky Mountain Excursion,
edited by Samuel Franklin Emmons. Comte Rendu de la Congrés
Géologique Internationale, 5me Session, Washington, 1891, 1893, pp. 253-487,
map and plates 13, figs. 32).</p>

<p>Our journey is begun at New York City, which is built about the deeply
submerged channels of an estuary choked with glacial deposits, though
the channel may be followed as a deep cañon across the continental shelf
to its margin (<a href="#Page_252">252</a>,<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> <a href="#p17b">pl. 17 B</a>). New York City is also upon the margin
of the glaciated area, the outer terminal moraine of which is well represented
on Long Island (<a href="#Page_298">298</a>). Across the Hudson in New Jersey is the
great Coastal Plain which meets the oldland in a well-defined margin (<a href="#Page_159">159</a>,
<a href="#Page_246">246</a>, <a href="#Page_247">247</a>). A local geological guide of the vicinity of the metropolis has
been written by Gratacap (Geology of the City of New York, Greater New
York. Brentanos, New York, 1904, pp. 119, pls. and map).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[476]</a></span></p>

<p>Traveling by the New York Central Railway, we follow up the Mohawk
outlet of the glacial lakes Iroquois and Algonquin (<a href="#Page_334">334</a>), first skirting upon
the east the great sills of intrusive basalt known as the Palisades, with
their markedly columnar jointing and intersections by numerous faults.
Above Peekskill we enter the picturesque narrows of the river (<a href="#Page_174">174</a>), cut
in the hard crystalline rocks of the Highlands. Entering the Mohawk
Valley, we pass Syracuse with limestone caverns and well-oriented joints
widened by solution through the agency of the descending ground water
(<a href="#Page_181">181</a>, <a href="#p6b">pl. 6 B</a>). A branch line to the southwest reaches the vicinity of
Cayuga Lake and Ithaca, where are well-oriented joints which have controlled
the drainage directions, and there is also a typical strath (<a href="#Page_55">55</a>, <a href="#Page_87">87</a>,
<a href="#Page_428">428</a>).</p>

<p>To Niagara Falls at least a day should be allotted for the “gorge ride”
by trolley car, thus making the complete circuit of the brink of the gorge
with interruptions and local studies at all important points (<a href="#Page_352">352-366</a>,
<a href="#p23a">pl. 23 A</a>). From Niagara Falls over the Michigan Central Railway we reach
Detroit on the present outlet of the upper Great Lakes as well as of the
later Lake Algonquin (<a href="#Page_334">334</a>). From this city as a center a trip is made by
electric railway to Ypsilanti and Ann Arbor, across the bottoms of the
early glacial lakes from the first Maumee to Warren (<a href="#Page_330">330-333</a>). The
strong Whittlesey beach is encountered at the little station of Ridge
Road, and one of the Maumee beaches on Summer Street in Ypsilanti.
The city of Ypsilanti is built upon a terrace (<a href="#Page_165">165</a>) of the Huron River,
and another terrace in the same series is crossed by the electric line. In
an excursion of a few miles down the river, passing meanders (<a href="#Page_164">164-165</a>)
and ox-bow lakes (<a href="#Page_165">165</a>, <a href="#Page_415">415</a>), is found an interesting case of stream capture
near the little village of Rawsonville (<a href="#Page_175">175</a>. See Isaiah Bowman, Jour.
Geol., Vol. 12, 1904, pp. 326-334).</p>

<p>Continuing our journey from Ypsilanti over a high moraine (<a href="#Page_312">312</a>), Ann
Arbor is reached, built upon the level plain of outwash with fosses sometimes
separating it from the moraine (<a href="#Page_281">281</a>, <a href="#Page_314">314</a>). Upon the campus of
the university are great bowlders of jasper conglomerate and jaspilite,
which were transported from the north by the continental glacier (<a href="#Page_305">305</a>).
Across the river from the Michigan Central station and behind the little
church is a delta formed in one of the glacial lakes Maumee and here
opened in section (<a href="#Page_168">168</a>). West of the city is a great valley which was the
former course of the Huron River when thus diverted by the continental
glacier lying to the eastward of Ann Arbor&mdash;border drainage (see Ann
Arbor folio by the U. S. G. S., and, further, R. C. Allen and I. D. Scott,
An Aid to Geological Field Studies in the Vicinity of Ann Arbor, George
Wahr, publisher, Ann Arbor).</p>

<p>Returning to Detroit (M. C. Ry.), the great Sibley quarries in limestone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[477]</a></span>
near Trenton may be visited. They display perfect jointing, numerous
fossils, and especially well-glaciated surfaces interrupted by deep troughs
and showing striæ of several glaciations (<a href="#Page_304">304</a>). From Detroit the journey
is continued by steamer to Mackinac Island in the strait connecting Lakes
Michigan and Huron, passing on the way through the peculiar delta of
the St. Clair River (<a href="#Page_431">431</a>), and coming in view of the notched headlands,
which are a monument to the post-glacial uplift of the glaciated area (<a href="#Page_250">250</a>,
<a href="#Page_341">341</a>). A day is spent at Mackinac Island and St. Ignace in order to study
with some care these uplifted strands of the late glacial lakes (<a href="#Page_341">341-344</a>).
Chicago may now be reached either by steamer or by rail, and in its vicinity
we may see the elevated beaches and the ancient outlet of Lake Chicago
(<a href="#Page_331">331-332</a>, <a href="#Page_347">347</a>, <a href="#p22a">pl. 22 A</a>. See Chicago Folio, U. S. G. S.). By the
Chicago and Northwestern Railway the area of recessional moraines and
intermediate outwash plains, and later that of the drumlins, are crossed in
journeying to Madison, Wisconsin. By examination of the maps on
pages 308 and 317 in connection with the larger scale atlas sheets of the
United States Geological Survey (Janesville, Evansville, and Madison
sheets), this car journey can be made most instructive in gaining familiarity
with the characteristic glacial features, and this study is continued to
special advantage in excursions about Madison as a center (<a href="#Page_316">316-317</a>, <a href="#Page_407">407</a>).
This is the more true since at numerous localities in the vicinity of Madison
the well-striated glacier pavement is exposed for comparison of the
striæ as regards direction with the axes of the several types of glacial
features.</p>

<p>An especially instructive excursion may be made by carriage in a single
day to the “driftless area” some twelve miles west of the city. Before
reaching it we cross in alternation a series of recessional terminal moraines
(<a href="#p17c">pl. 17 C</a>) and outwash plains, and near Cross Plains encounter the partially
dissected upland with its arborescent drainage and even sky line (<a href="#Page_298">298</a>,
<a href="#Page_300">300-301</a>, <a href="#Page_312">312-313</a>, <a href="#p16a">pl. 16 A</a> and <a href="#p16b">B</a>). Typical shore formations (<a href="#Page_233">233</a>, <a href="#Page_241">241</a>,
<a href="#Page_242">242</a>) are studied to advantage about Lake Mendota in a walking trip to
and beyond Picnic Point, where are found the best ice ramparts (<a href="#Page_431">431-434</a>.
See Buckley, Trans. Wis. Acad. Sci., Vol. 13, pp. 141-162, pls. 18).</p>

<p>Our journey is now continued over the Chicago and Northwestern
Railway to Devils Lake near Baraboo, where we cross a salient of the
driftless area, within which lies Devils Lake, imprisoned in a former valley
of the Wisconsin River, since diverted to another course as a result of the
glacial invasion (<a href="#Page_312">312-313</a>). The valley here is a former narrows in hard
quartzite (<a href="#Page_466">466</a>), which towers above the lake in unstable chimneys (<a href="#Page_300">300</a>),
such as the Devils Tower, but such remnants are not found on the other
side of the moraine, being there replaced by rounded rock shoulders. Just
north of the lake the marginal moraine which blocks the valley is so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[478]</a></span>
characteristic as to merit special study (<a href="#p17c">pl. 17 C</a>). Only a few miles northward
along the railway from Devils Lake is Ableman, where, exposed in
a high cliff, the hard purple quartzite with beautiful ripple marks to reveal
its plane of sedimentation (<a href="#p11a">pl. 11 A</a>) dips vertically, and is overlain by
horizontally bedded yellow sandstone. The marked angular unconformity
which is thus displayed is further made evident by a basal layer of conglomerate
(<a href="#Page_463">463</a>) in the sandstone (<a href="#Page_51">51-53</a>). Here also are deposits of loess
along the river, which display their vertical joint surfaces (<a href="#Page_207">207</a>). An
excellent geological guide to this interesting district and that of the neighboring
“Dalles” of the Wisconsin River has been written by Salisbury
and Atwood (The Geography of the Region about Devils Lake and the
Dalles of the Wisconsin, etc., Bull. 5, Wis. Geol. and Nat. Hist. Surv., 1900,
pp. 151, pls. 38, figs. 47).</p>

<p>If we have taken a conveyance at Devils Lake for Ableman, we may
continue in the same manner to Kilbourn, where begin the picturesque
Dalles of the Wisconsin River&mdash;here a young gorge cut in sandstone,
because the Wisconsin was diverted from its old valley to border drainage
at the edge of the driftless area (<a href="#Page_300">300</a>, <a href="#Page_321">321</a>). The side cañons of the river,
through their abrupt zigzags, reveal the control of their courses by the joint
system (<a href="#Page_224">224</a>). In the journey up the rapids by steamer to inspect the
Dalles, we observe many beautiful examples of cross bedding in the sandstone
(<a href="#Page_37">37</a>).</p>

<p>From Kilbourn we continue our journey to Minneapolis over the Chicago,
Milwaukee, and St. Paul Railway, and near Camp Douglas are over a peneplain,
out of which rise prominent monadnocks (<a href="#Page_171">171</a>). At La Crosse the
Mississippi River is reached, flowing beneath bluffs of sandstone which are
capped by loess (<a href="#Page_207">207</a>). The meanderings and the numerous cut-offs of
the Mississippi may be observed to the left (<a href="#Page_415">415</a>). Lake Pepin is a side-delta
lake blocked by the deposits of the Chippewa River (<a href="#Page_419">419</a>).</p>

<p>From Minneapolis an excursion is made to Fort Snelling to view the
young gorge of the Mississippi, cut by the Falls of St. Anthony for a distance
of about eight miles in manner similar to that of the seven miles of Niagara
gorge (<a href="#Page_354">354</a>), and to compare this narrow gorge with the broad valley of the
Warren River which drained Lake Agassiz (<a href="#Page_327">327</a>). Somewhat farther up
the Warren River are examples of saucer lakes (<a href="#Page_416">416</a>).</p>

<p>From Minneapolis the journey may be continued by the Great Northern
Railway to Livingston, Montana, thus crossing between the stations of
Muscoda and Buffalo the bed of Lake Agassiz and its marginal beaches
(<a href="#Page_325">325-328</a>. For local geology of Minnesota consult C. W. Hall, Geology
of Minnesota, Vol. 1, Minneapolis, 1903).</p>

<p>The Yellowstone Park is entered from Livingston (Livingston Geological
Folio, U. S. G. S.) and departure from it made at the relatively new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[479]</a></span>
Union Pacific terminal at the southwest margin. The regular trip
through the Park includes visits to the several geyser basins (<a href="#Page_191">191-194</a>),
Obsidian Cliff (<a href="#Page_33">33</a>, <a href="#Page_463">463</a>), the Cañon of the Yellowstone, etc. Good climbers
can make a side trip from near the Mammoth Hot Springs to the top of
Quadrant Mountain, the remnant of a “biscuit cut” upland (<a href="#Page_372">372</a>), and
there study the nivation process (<a href="#Page_368">368</a>, Yellowstone National Park Folio,
U. S. G. S.).</p>

<p>The trip from the Park to Salt Lake City, over the Union Pacific Railway,
passes through the Red Rock Pass, the former outlet of Lake Bonneville
(<a href="#Page_423">423</a>), into the desert of the Great Basin ( <a href="#Page_197">Chaps. XV</a> and <a href="#Page_209">XVI</a>).
Great Salt Lake is a saline lake or sink with an interesting record of climatic
changes (<a href="#Page_198">198</a>, <a href="#Page_401">401</a>). The front of the Wasatch Range, in view and
easily reached from Salt Lake City, is deeply scored by the horizontal
shore terraces of Lake Bonneville (<a href="#Page_198">198</a>, <a href="#Page_199">199</a>), and these terraces are extended
at every reëntrant by barrier beaches of great perfection. In the
Pleistocene period mountain glaciers in part occupied the valleys of this
range, though they did not always extend as far as the mountain front.
Big Cottonwood Cañon, which realizes this condition, and the neighboring
Little Cottonwood Cañon, from whose front its glacier spread into an
expanded foot (<a href="#Page_264">264</a>), thus show for comparison in a single view the <span class="font">V</span>
and the low <span class="font">U</span> sections respectively (<a href="#Page_172">172</a>, <a href="#Page_376">376</a>). Here are also alluvial
fans (<a href="#Page_213">213</a>) and recent faults which intersect them.</p>

<p>From Salt Lake City the return to New York may be made by the
Denver and Rio Grande Railway across deserts and through the Royal
Gorge, the cañon of the Arkansas River. A full itinerary of the points
of geological interest along this route, and continued to Chicago, Washington,
and New York, is supplied in much detail in the guide of the geological
excursion to the Rocky Mountains above cited. This the traveling geologist
should not fail to study. Some references to points along this
journey will be found on preceding pages of this book (<a href="#Page_219">219-220</a>, High
Plains; <a href="#Page_170">170</a>, Allegheny Plateau in West Virginia; <a href="#Page_176">176</a>, water gap of
Harper’s Ferry; <a href="#Page_176">176-177</a>, <a href="#Page_184">184-186</a>, side trip up the Shenandoah Valley
to Luray Caverns and Snickers Gap; <a href="#Page_251">251</a>, Chesapeake Bay).</p>

<p>Instead of returning directly from Salt Lake City, the traveler, if he
has sufficient time at his disposal, may extend his journey southwestward
across the Great Basin to Los Angeles. A branch line from this route
leaves the Vegas Valley and passes within reach of the famous Death
Valley (<a href="#Page_201">201</a>) to Tonopah (<a href="#Page_79">79</a>) and the Owens Valley (<a href="#Page_77">77-78</a>, <a href="#Page_92">92</a>), where are
many surface faults dating from the earthquake of 1872 and other less
recent disturbances. Returning to the junction point, the route continues
across the Colorado and Mohave deserts to Los Angeles. From Los Angeles
as a center the exceptionally interesting terraces, caves, and stacks of an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[480]</a></span>
uplifted coast are to be seen to best advantage near Pt. Harford
(<a href="#Page_245">Chap. XIX</a>). The islands of San Clemente and Santa Catalina may also be
reached from Los Angeles (<a href="#Page_239">239</a>, <a href="#Page_248">248</a>, <a href="#Page_249">249</a>, <a href="#Page_250">250</a>, <a href="#Page_256">256</a>, <a href="#Page_257">257</a>, <a href="#p5b">pls. 5 B</a>, <a href="#p7a">7 A</a>,
<a href="#p12a">12 A</a>). The return to the East, if made by the Santa Fe Railway, permits
of a visit to the Grand Cañon (<a href="#Page_174">174</a>, <a href="#Page_443">443</a>) from the station of Williams.
From that point eastward the geology of the route is fully covered in Emmons’
Guide to the Rocky Mountain Excursion already cited.</p>

<p>For the benefit of those who are privileged to travel in Europe, and the
number increases yearly, a pilgrimage is suggested which may easily be
made to correspond with plans laid out on the basis of historical, artistic,
and scenic points of interest. The only popular guide of a general nature
written for geologists traveling abroad appears to be a brief but valuable
little paper by Professor Lane (The Geological Tourist in Europe, Popular
Science Monthly, Vol. 33, 1888, pp. 216-229). The publishing house of
Gebrüder Bornträger in Berlin is now publishing a quite valuable series
of geological guides dealing with special districts and written by well-known
authorities (Sammlung Geologischer Führer). Of this series some
thirteen numbers have already been issued. Many other valuable local
guides of a geological nature are the Livrets Guides of the International
Geological and Geographical Congresses, and the similar pamphlets supplied
in connection with annual meetings of national or provincial geological
societies.</p>

<p>Passengers on steamships sailing from the harbor of New York pass out
over a deeply submerged cañon (<a href="#Page_252">252</a>) largely filled with glacial deposits,
through the Narrows (<a href="#Page_174">174</a>), and in sight of Sandy Hook, a modified spit
(<a href="#Page_238">238</a>, <a href="#Page_240">240</a>). To the left are seen the great morainic accumulations at the
border of the glaciated area on Long Island (<a href="#Page_298">298</a>). In the course of the
trans-Atlantic voyage a much-rounded iceberg may be encountered (<a href="#Page_291">291</a>),
though this is much more apt to occur upon the northern routes from
Quebec, and late in the season. Upon entering the English Channel the
land on both coasts rises in steep cliffs, where are found all the common shore
features well developed (<a href="#Page_231">Chap. XVIII</a>). The German steamships pass
in sight of Heligoland, that last remnant of wave erosion (<a href="#Page_236">236</a>).</p>

<p>While traveling in Europe, the student should consult a map of the
glaciated area (<a href="#Page_299">299</a>), and so learn to recognize its peculiarities, and carefully
mark its marginal moraine (<a href="#Page_311">311</a>) and other strongly marked features.</p>

<p>If the British Isles are visited and the more rugged areas are selected,
one may study the cirques and other characteristic features due to the
presence of mountain glaciers about Snowdon (<a href="#Page_367">Chap. XXVI</a>). More
mature stages of the same processes are to be found in the Scottish Highlands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[481]</a></span>
and the Inner Hebrides, but especially upon the Island of Skye (<a href="#f492">Fig. 492</a>).
A very valuable aid to excursions in this district is Baddeley’s
Scotland (part I, Dulau, London) and Sir Archibald Geikie’s Explanatory
Notes to accompany Bartholomew’s Geological Map of Scotland
(map and notes in cover, Edinburgh, 1892, pp. 23).</p>

<p>It is from Oban, the “Charing Cross of the Highlands”, that one should
start out upon the summer steamers in order to reach both Skye and
Staffa, the latter with fine basaltic columns (<a href="#Page_463">463</a>), and Fingal’s Cave. In
sailing to Skye one passes upon either shore of the narrow fjords many
relics left in the dissection of volcanoes (<a href="#Page_139">139-143</a> and Sir A. Geikie, Ancient
Volcanoes of Great Britain, Vol. II); also rocky islands and skerries
marking submergence (<a href="#Page_252">252</a>), and the coast terraces which register a later
uplift (<a href="#Page_250">250</a>). Skye is a complex of many intrusive and volcanic rocks of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[482]</a></span>
such markedly different colors as to appear as tints in the landscape.
In the Cuchillin Hills of dark green rises the massive gabbro (<a href="#Page_462">462</a>) cut by
cirques into the jagged pinnacles of horns and comb ridges (<a href="#Page_373">373</a>); while
lower down and to the east are rounded domes of rhyolite (<a href="#Page_463">463</a>) abraded
beneath the glaciers and of a delicate salmon tint. Still lower and to the
westward are flat mesas composed of horizontal layers of black basalt
under a rich carpeting of the brightest verdure. Eastward across the
channel are seen the purplish walls of an ancient sandstone. The jagged
gabbro core of the island thus represents a fretted upland (<a href="#Page_372">372</a>) and is
now the training ground of the Alpinist (Abraham, Rock Climbing in
Skye, Longmans, London, 1908), while nestled in one of the bottoms of a
<span class="font">U</span>-valley is Loch Coruisk, a typical rock-basin lake (<a href="#Page_412">412</a>), its shores of hard
rock planed and scored.</p>

<p>From Skye we may go to study the remarkable thrusts (<a href="#Page_45">45</a>) on the north
shore of Loch Maree, a marked lineament, and one directed at right angles
to that on the course of the Caledonian Canal connecting Loch Linne with
Loch Ness. This northeast wall of Loch Maree is a strikingly rectilinear
fault represented by an escarpment, up which we climb to find at the top
the crushed and fluted thrust planes of movement dipping southeastward
at a flat angle. Here also are beautiful rock-basin lakes, lying in hollows
molded beneath the continental glacier. On our way from Skye we have
passed up Loch Carron, a sea loch or fjord (<a href="#Page_252">252</a>), and along the strath at its
head known as Strathcarron (<a href="#Page_428">428</a>).</p>

<p>Returning now to Oban, it is but a short trip by steamer up Loch Linne
to Fort William along the striking lineament (<a href="#Page_226">226</a>) which continues to
Loch Ness and beyond (<a href="#f492">Fig. 492</a>), and thence by rail to Glen Roy and the
neighboring glens of Lochaber (<a href="#Page_322">322-325</a>).</p>

<p>From Paris as a starting point, we may visit in a most picturesque region
the beautifully preserved craters of extinct volcanoes in the Auvergne of
Central France (<a href="#Page_105">105</a>, <a href="#Page_124">124</a>, <a href="#Page_145">145</a>), which district is entered from Clermont-Ferrand.
Here are found the characteristic puys, steep lava domes of
viscous lava (<a href="#Page_105">105</a>), which figured largely in the early controversies of geologists
concerning the origin of rocks.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div></div>

<p>The rest of our pilgrimage will be so planned as to enter the noble river
Rhine at its mouth (<a href="#f493">Fig. 493</a>), ascend its course to its birthplace in the
snows of Switzerland, and after further exploration of the features of this
fretted upland, traverse northern and central Italy so as to make our
departure for America by the southern route. Entering then upon this
course in the Low Countries, we have first the opportunity of observing
the characteristics of a great delta with natural levees artificially
strengthened as dikes (<a href="#Page_165">165-168</a>). Here also are found dunes of beach
material which has been raised by the wind into a great rampart near the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[483]</a></span>
shore (<a href="#Page_209">209-211</a>). Such a wall of dune sand is well displayed at the bathing
resort at Scheveningen near the Hague (<a href="#Page_421">421</a>). The flood plain of the
Rhine (<a href="#Page_162">162-165</a>) may be studied in a journey up the river to the university
town of Bonn, from whence a day’s excursion should be devoted
to the relics of volcanoes known as the Seven Mountains (H. von Dechen,
Geognostischer Führer in das Siebengebirge, Bonn, 1861). As a preparation
for this trip and others in the volcanic Eifel higher up the river, a visit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[484]</a></span>
should be made to the mineral and rock collections of the Poppelsdorfer
Schloss at the University. In the volcanic Eifel are found some of the
most interesting of crater lakes (<a href="#Page_405">405</a>), the largest being Lake Laach with
its somewhat peculiar volcanic ejectamenta and its picturesque abbey (see
von Dechen, Geognostischer Führer zu der Vulkanreihe der Vorder-Eifel,
etc., Bonn, 1886. Consult also Lane, A Geological Tourist in Europe, <i>l.c.</i>).</p>

<p>Continuing our course up the river from Bonn, we soon enter the gorge
of the Rhine cut in an uplifted peneplain (<a href="#Page_169">169</a>, <a href="#Page_171">171</a>, <a href="#Page_174">174</a>). From Coblenz,
where the Moselle enters the Rhine, a side trip may be made up this tributary
river past Zell with its entrenched meanders (<a href="#Page_173">173</a>) to the ancient
Roman city of Treves. Above Bingen on the Rhine we leave behind us
the narrow gorge and rapid current of the river and continue over the broad
floor at the bottom of a rift valley (<a href="#Page_403">403</a>), lying between the forest of Odin
and the Black Forest on the east and the “Blue Alsatian Mountains”
far away to the west. At the margins of this plain are beds of loess with
their characteristic joint structures and inclusions (<a href="#Page_207">207</a>), and in the higher
hills on either hand a wealth of intrusive igneous rocks.</p>

<p>At the entrance of the Neckar River to this broad plain is nestled the
picturesque castle and university town of Heidelberg, a convenient center
for excursions (Julius Ruska, Geologische Streifzüge in Heidelbergs
Umgebung, etc., Nägele, Leipzig, 1908, pp. 208, map). At Strassburg
(Schwarzwaldstrasse 12) is located the German Chief Station for Earthquake
Study, with a particularly large set of modern seismographs. In
the university cabinet is also one of the largest and most representative
mineral collections in Europe. For excursions in the neighborhood consult
Benecke, Sammlung Geognostische Führer, Vol. 5, Elsass, 1900.</p>

<p>From Strassburg we may go by the Black Forest Railway to the Hegau
with its volcanic plugs (<a href="#Page_140">140</a>), each surmounted by a picturesque castle.
We enter next the broadly extended piedmont apron site, above which
Lake Constance still remains as a border lake (<a href="#Page_399">399</a>). Outwash aprons
(<a href="#Page_314">314</a>), moraines (<a href="#Page_311">311</a>), and drumlins (<a href="#Page_317">317</a>) are each in turn encountered.
Still continuing our course up the Rhine from Bregenz, we enter the fretted
upland (<a href="#Page_372">372</a>) of the Alps, mountains composed of great folds and thrusts
about a core of intrusive rock (Rothpletz, Sammlung Geologische Führer,
Vol. 10, 1902, Thrusts in the Alps between Lake Constance and the
Engadine). Some fourteen miles above Chur we pass the terrace produced
by successive landslides (<a href="#Page_414">414</a>), known far and wide as the Flimser
Bergstürz. The further assent of the cascade stairway of this glacier-carved
valley brings us to the Furka Pass, from which point magnificent
views of the fretted upland are obtained. At the Känzli, a mile from
the hotel, one may view the névé of the Rhone Glacier, which may also
be easily visited.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[485]</a></span></p>

<p>We have now followed a great river from its mouth in the sands of
Holland to its source in the snows of the higher Alps. Passing over the
divide and descending to Gletsch, we may observe the lower end, or foot,
of the Rhone glacier and the crevasses and séracs (<a href="#Page_391">391</a>) on the steep descent
of this radiating glacier (<a href="#Page_383">383</a>, <a href="#Page_386">386</a>). The response which glaciers make to
climatic changes is here well illustrated by the recession of the glacier
front from near the hotel (its position in the ’50s of the nineteenth century)
to its present position about a mile farther up the valley.</p>

<p>The characteristics of a glaciated mountain valley may be further
illustrated by climbing to the Grimsel Pass, which is scratched and striated
(<a href="#Page_377">377</a>, <a href="#Page_385">385</a>), and then descending the valley of the Aar to Meyringen (<a href="#Page_377">377</a>).
Near the Grimsel Hospice are the characteristic rock basin lakes (<a href="#Page_412">412</a>),
and upon the Aar Glacier to our left were carried out the epoch-making
researches of Louis Agassiz, the founder of the glacial theory for explaining
the drift. We encounter some thirteen rock bars (<a href="#Page_377">377</a>). Just before
reaching Meyringen we pass the last of these, the Gorge of the Aar, cut
by the stream through limestone.</p>

<p>Interlaken (<a href="#Page_419">419</a>) may be made the center for additional excursions up
the Lauterbrunnen Valley, with its prominent albs (<a href="#Page_376">376</a>) and its ribbon
fall of the Staubbach (<a href="#Page_378">378</a>). By the Jungfrau Mountain railway we may
now ascend partly in tunnels of the rock to the Ewigeismeer, and look
down upon the névé and bergschrunds of the Great Aletsch Glacier (<a href="#Page_370">370</a>,
see Baltzer, Sammlung Geologische Führer, Vol. 10, Bernese Oberland,
1906). Returning to Interlaken by way of Grindelwald, one may study
the foot of a radiating glacier, the Untergrindelwald glacier, with its tunnel
and its milky and braided stream.</p>

<p>Crossing now the Alpine foreland to Villeneuve at the upper end of Lake
Geneva and upon a well-developed strath (<a href="#Page_426">426</a>, <a href="#Page_428">428</a>), we may look out
upon the turbid waters extending far from the shore of the lake. Journeying
to Geneva by steamer we note the gradual clearing of the water until
at the outlet of the lake it is as clear as crystal. A walking trip from
Geneva takes us to the Bois de la Bâtie, where the Arve with turbid waters
meets this clear stream (<a href="#Page_427">427</a>).</p>

<p>The railroad to Chamonix ascends another cascade stairway (<a href="#Page_376">376</a>),
affords views of complexly folded sedimentary rocks (<a href="#Page_43">43</a>), and at Chamonix
itself the mer de glace supplies opportunities for the study of moraines
(<a href="#Page_386">386</a>, <a href="#Page_393">393</a>) and glacial movement (<a href="#Page_390">390-392</a>). To experienced Alpinists
the summit of Mount Blanc offers a remarkably extended outlook over the
fretted upland of the Alps (<a href="#p18a">pl. 18 A</a>). From the station of LeFayet below
Chamonix, one may ascend to the Désert de la Platé, where are Schratten
in limestone due to solution (<a href="#Page_188">188</a>).</p>

<p>Crossing by one of the passes to the valley of the Rhone at Martigny<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[486]</a></span>
we may reach Zermatt, to-day the climbing center of the Alps. From the
subordinate cirques surrounding this village descend the Gorner, Findelen,
St. Theodul, and other components of this radiating glacier. A black
tooth of rock, the Matterhorn, towers above the other peaks and shows to
greatest advantage this feature of glacial sculpture (<a href="#Page_374">374</a>), while the Gorge
of the Gorner is a severed rock bar like that of the Aar (<a href="#Page_377">377</a>). Either on
foot or over the mountain railway we may ascend to the Gorner Grat,
a subordinate comb ridge (<a href="#Page_373">373</a>) which affords one of the most magnificent
and instructive views of radiating glaciers.</p>

<p>From Brig, farther up the Rhone Valley, an excursion is made to the
Eggishorn Hotel, a center for study on and about the Great Aletsch
Glacier (<a href="#Page_329">329</a>, <a href="#Page_371">371</a>, <a href="#Page_385">385</a>, <a href="#Page_388">388</a>, <a href="#Page_395">395</a>, <a href="#Page_410">410</a>). The easy ascent of the Eggishorn
is rewarded by a view almost directly downward upon the ice-dammed
Márjelen Lake (<a href="#Page_329">329</a>, <a href="#Page_411">411</a>).</p>

<p>From Brig one may make his entry into Italy, either over the picturesque
Simplon route afoot or by diligence, or else beneath it through the
railway tunnel. By an alternation of short steamboat and rail trips the
journey is continued in a direction transverse to the longer axes of the
border lakes Maggiore, Lugano, and Como, and later southward to Milan.
In leaving the village of Como we pass over heavy morainic deposits on
the apron borders of the expanded-foot glacier (<a href="#Page_383">383</a>, <a href="#Page_385">385</a>) which once
occupied the valley above. On the journey from Milan to Venice, over
the fertile plains of Lombardy, the similar accumulations about Lake
Garda (<a href="#Page_414">414</a>) are first encountered at the little station of Lonato and left
behind at Somma Campagna (Tornquist, Sammlung Geologische Führer,
Vol. 9, Northern Italy, 1902).</p>

<p>The city of Venice is built upon pile foundations in the lagoon behind
the barrier beach known as the Lido (<a href="#Page_242">242</a>, <a href="#Page_428">428-429</a>). From here we may
reach the Karst country by way of Trieste, some of the more interesting
and typical features being found near Divača (<a href="#Page_187">187-189</a>, <a href="#Page_422">422</a>, <a href="#p6a">pl. 6 A</a>). In
a different direction from Venice by way of Belluno we enter the Dolomites
with their patterned relief and battlemented towers (<a href="#Page_228">228</a>, <a href="#Page_445">445</a>).</p>

<p>Additional centers for geological excursions on the route to our point of
departure from Italy are Rome and Naples. At the Italian capitol and
in its neighborhood we may study the volcanic Campagna with its beds
of tuff (<a href="#Page_105">105</a>) and its crater lakes (405. See Sir A. Geikie, The Roman Campagna,
Landscape in History and other Essays, Macmillan, 1905, pp. 308-352;
also Deecke, Sammlung Geologische Führer, Vol. 8, Campagna, 1901).
From Rome it is an easy journey to the cataract of Tivoli with its deposits
of travertine (<a href="#Page_184">184</a>). In the opposite direction from Rome across the
Campagna rise the Alban Hills, ruins of a composite cone with several
crater lakes on the sites of former vents. On the summit of the encircling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[487]</a></span>
crater rim, like the Monte Somma of the Vesuvian Mountain now a crescent
only, is located the chief Italian station for earthquake study.</p>

<p>From Naples we may reach in short excursions and study with some care
still active volcanic mountains. To the east is Mount Vesuvius (<a href="#Page_94">94</a>, <a href="#Page_97">97</a>,
<a href="#Page_122">122</a>, <a href="#Page_124">124</a>, <a href="#Page_127">127-137</a>), which was in grand eruption in April, 1906. Westward
from Naples are the Campi Phlegraeii, or burning fields, with many craters.
Of these Astroni offers a fine example of a large-cratered cinder cone (<a href="#Page_105">105</a>).
In the same vicinity are Monte Nuovo (<a href="#Page_96">96</a>) and the Solfatara (<a href="#Page_97">97</a>), the
latter a type of volcano which no longer erupts lava, but in its place emits
carbon dioxide and other gaseous emanations (Grotto del Cane). The
starting point for excursions in the Phlegræan fields is Pozzuoli with its
Temple of Jupiter Serapis (<a href="#Page_254">254-255</a>), reached from Naples by an electric
line which pierces the wall of an immense crater (Posilippo) composed of
fine yellow volcanic ash known as Pozzuolan.</p>

<p>From Naples steamers make short excursions to Sorrento with its deep
ash deposits, and to Capri with its blue grotto (<a href="#Page_257">257-258</a>). Herculaneum
(<a href="#Page_139">139</a>) and Pompeii (<a href="#Page_122">122</a>), buried during the eruption of 79 <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>, are on the
line of the Circum-Vesuvian Railway.</p>

<p>Steamships to New York from Naples call at Gibraltar, the land-tied
island <i>par excellence</i> (<a href="#Page_241">241</a>). Most steamships of the southern route pass
through or near the volcanic islands of the Azores, and certain boats touch
at Algiers, from which a line of railway gives access to Biskra on the
borders of the Desert of Sahara.</p>

<p>Throughout these pilgrimages the traveler should be on the alert to
note not only the agent responsible for the features which come under his
observation, but, especially where this is the common sculpturing agent
of running water, he should not fail to notice the stage of the erosion
cycle which is represented (<a href="#Page_169">Chapter XIII</a>).</p>

electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.</p>

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work

phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>

<blockquote><p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United
  States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost
  no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use
  it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with

  are not located in the United States, you'll have to check the laws
  of the country where you are located before using this
  ebook.</p></blockquote>

<p>1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.</p>

<p>1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.</p>

<p>1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.</p>

<p>1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.</li>

<li>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.</p>

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.  </p>

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
